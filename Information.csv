- Room Temperature Electrochemical Synthesis of Ordered Intermetallic Materials
Ordered intermetallic compounds (OICs), alloys with long range atomic ordering, exhibit important and useful properties for catalysis, electronics, corrosion/sintering resistance and other applications and are often superior to solid-solution alloys when in a nanostructured form. Despite decades of intense research, OIC nanoparticles have failed to replace conventional nanomaterials due to (1) lack of low-temperature synthetic methods which can overcome slow solid-state diffusion rates which inhibits atomic ordering, (2) inability to tune composition and phase to optimize the desired application, and (3) lack of fundamental understanding needed for progress on these issues. The Hall group is currently developing electrochemical methods (e.g. electrochemical dealloying, electrodeposition) to prepare nanostructured OICs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Our experimental program has laid the foundation for a fundamentally new approach for the synthesis of nanostructured OICs at room temperature. We will uncover meaningful trends that will enable us to link our insights to produce materials with tailored compositions, permitting the design of high-performance nanomaterials which are difficult to access by conventional methods.

- Electrochemically Mediated Renewable Energy Conversion
The Hall group investigates chemical reactions catalyzed by solid surfaces to address problems in renewable energy storage and utilization. We design ordered intermetallic materials interrogate their performance for mediating electrochemical reactions. Ordered intermetallic materials are advantageous over disordered alloys because they usually exhibit improved catalytic performance and stability. We also interrogate the adsorption dynamics of the metal-solution interface by Surface Enhanced Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to understand how material structure and solvent play a role in controlling catalytic performance. We are interested in probing reactions such as fuel cell catalysis, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and electro-organic chemistry.",MD Hall 107,Wyman Quad,https://engineering.jhu.edu/hall/

Adam Riess,Bloomberg Distinguished Professor ,Department of Physics & Astronomy," Observations of physical cosmology, primarily through the use of distance indicators like supernovae; measurements of dark energy and the expansion history of the universe using optical and near-infrared instruments from space and the ground","Pan-STARRS—the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System—is an innovative design for a wide-field imaging facility being developed at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.

By combining relatively small mirrors with very large digital cameras we will be able to develop and deploy an economical observing system that will be able to observe the entire available sky several times each month.

The immediate goal of Pan-STARRS is to discover and characterize Earth-approaching objects, both asteroids & comets, which might pose a danger to our planet.

The huge volume of images produced by this system will provide valuable data for many other kinds of scientific programs. Click here for more Information.

A unique facet of Pan-STARRS is its ability to discover transient phenomena in the Universe, including approximately 10,000 new supernovae.

SHOES-Supernovae, HO, for the Equation of State of Dark energy
The present uncertainty in the value of the Hubble constant (resulting in an uncertainty in ΩM) and the paucity of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts exceeding 1 are now the leading obstacles to determining the nature of dark energy. We propose a single, integrated set of observations for Cycle 15 that will provide a 40% improvement in constraints on dark energy. This program will observe known Cepheids in six reliable hosts of Type Ia supernovae with NICMOS, reducing the uncertainty in H_0 by a factor of two because of the smaller dispersion along the instability strip, the diminished extinction, and the weaker metallicity dependence in the infrared. In parallel with ACS, at the same time the NICMOS observations are underway, we will discover and follow a sample of Type Ia supernovae at z > 1.

Together, these measurements, along with prior constraints from WMAP, will provide a great improvement in HST's ability to distinguish between a static, cosmological constant and dynamical dark energy. The Hubble Space Telescope is the only instrument in the world that can make these IR measurements of Cepheids beyond the Local Group, and it is the only telescope in the world that can be used to find and follow supernovae at z > 1. Our program exploits both of these unique capabilities of HST to learn more about one of the greatest mysteries in science.

Recent Research

PANS-Probing Acceleration Now with Supernovae
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide the most direct evidence for an accelerating Universe, a result widely attributed to dark energy. Our on-going space-based survey (now called PANS) uses the Hubble Space Telescope to conduct a powerful and straightforward test of the new cosmological model. Observations of SNe Ia at z > 1 are expected to show evidence for a past epoch of cosmic deceleration, a clear signature of a mixed dark-matter and dark-energy Universe.

This survey also provides measurements of the evolution in supernova rates. This allows for alternative measures of the star formation rate history, and give insight on the plausible models for SN Ia progenitor models.

Understanding dark energy may be the biggest current challenge to cosmology and particle physics. To understand the nature of dark energy, we seek to measure its two most fundamental properties: its evolution (i.e., dw/dz), and its recent equation of state (i.e., w(z=0)). SNe Ia at z>1, beyond the reach of the ground but squarely within the reach of HST with ACS, are crucial to break the degeneracy in the measurements of these two basic aspects of dark energy. Here we propose double the precision of dark energy constraints. Should the current best fit model prove to be the correct one, the precision expected from the current proposal will suffice to rule out a cosmological constant at the 99% confidence level. Whatever the result, these objects will provide the basis with which to extend our empirical knowledge of this newly discovered and dominant component of the Universe, and will remain one of the most significant legacies of HST. In addition, our survey and follow-up data will greatly enhance the value of the archival data within the target Treasury fields for galaxy studies.",Bloomberg 207,Bloomberg Center,https://www.stsci.edu/~ariess/

Sensory experience has a profound influence in shaping the functional organization of the cerebral cortex. Over 30 years ago, Hubel and Wiesel described a critical period of postnatal development for the formation of binocular connections in cat visual cortex. They demonstrated that thisconnectivity can be dramatically altered by simple forms of sensory deprivation, such as the temporary closure of one eyelid (monoculardeprivation). Besides the obvious relevance of this neural plasticity to the development of visual capabilities in humans and animals, it seems likely hat similar processes form the basis for some forms of learning and memory in the adult brain. Indeed, visual cortical plasticity, like learning andmemory formation decreases with age and depend on the internal state of the animal. The research in this lab is directed toward elucidating thebasic mechanisms by which visual experience can modify cortical connections in the visual cortex, and how those mechanisms are regulated.

 We investigate in visual cortical slices two forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These two forms of synaptic plasticity are currently the most comprehensive models of the elementary mechanisms underlying naturallyoccurring plasticity. Research done the past few has established that LTP and LTD have the appropriate properties to account for important features of naturally-occurring synaptic modification in visual cortex. Furthermore, changes in LTP and LTD during development correlate withchanges in naturally-occurring synaptic modification.

We are currently focused on how synaptic inhibition and the action of neuromodulators regulate the induction of LTP and LTD duringdevelopment. The results of these investigation suggest two hypotheses. 1) The development of synaptic inhibition restricts the induction of LTPand LTD, and henceforth, the modification by experience to a short critical period. 2) The action of neuromodulators released during arousal is to enhance the induction LTP and LTD by orders of magnitude, thus enabling experience to modify the visual cortex. Our expectation is that by testing these specific hypothesis we are stand to gain a better understanding of how naturally occurring plasticity is regulated.",Brain/ Dunning 350,Dunning,

Andrei Gritsan,Professor,Department of Physics & Astronomy, Experimental high-energy physics; colliders,"Prof. Gritsan's research is focused on the observation and study of the new form of matter-energy, such as the Higgs boson. Prof. Gritsan works across boundaries of experimental and theoretical development. He engaged with a group of experts in development of new methods for analysis and interpretation of the data, which are known as MELA technique and JHU generator for the angular, kinematic, and statistical analysis of the decay products and associated particles of the H boson. Read more about this effort. He has been an active member of the LHC Higgs Physics Working Group, where he is a member of the Steering Committee, and he is one of the founding conveners of the LHC Effective Field Theory Working Group. He is deeply interested in the Higgs physics and other developments in particles physics and participates in the Snowmass-2001, 2013, 2021 activities to shape future directions in the field.

Prior to LHC, direct access to new fundamental particles (such as the Higgs boson or new states) was beyond the energy reach of operating accelerators. Gritsan worked with the heavy flavor quarks, such as the ""beauty"" or b quark, which were produced in electron-positron annihilations at the BABAR and CLEO experiments. He was looking for new ways to search for new fundamental particles that could exist briefly as heavy virtual states in the decays of b quarks. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum physics allows such non-trivial effects, called ""penguin"" loops, to occur for short instants. On CLEO, he discovered this process as part of his Ph.D. research. It was the first observation of the gluonic penguin transition b->s+gluon. On the BABAR experiment, he discovered a surprisingly large transverse polarization of the vector mesons produced in a penguin decay, which contradicted all expectations and may become evidence for new particles and interactions, and took this approach of angular analysis to a new level.

Prof. Gritsan is also an expert on various aspects of high-energy physics detectors, such as silicon tracking detectors, electromagnetic calorimeters, tracking drift chambers, triggers. He had been leading the tracking and silicon detector alignment groups at the BARAR and CMS experiments. An essential element of the LHC program is the alignment of thousands of silicon detectors that track the particles' paths which must be understood to micron precision. Prof. Gritsan led the CMS team to successful commissioning of its silicon tracker alignment at the time of data-taking startup and was an editor of the very first CMS publication.",Bloomberg 433,Bloomberg Center,https://gritsan.pha.jhu.edu/

Andrew Ewald,Professor ,"Biomedical Engineering,Cell Biology,Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center,Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences (IBBS),Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT)","Cellular and molecular mechanisms of epithelial growth, invasion and metastasis; focus on how clusters of cancer cells disseminate from the tumor, traverse the systemic circulation, and cooperate with resident stromal cells to colonize distant organs; 1) Mechanisms driving growth and development of normal epithelial cells; 2) Cellular strategies driving cancer invasion and metastasis; 3) Regulation of cancer progression by the tumor microenvironment","The Ewald Lab seeks to understand how groups of cells cooperate, compete, and interact to organize tissue architecture and function during development and disease progression. Our foundation is the understanding of normal organ architecture and development: how are they built during early development and then remodeled during adult life? Our disease focus is on breast cancer and, specifically, on elucidating the cellular strategies and molecular mechanisms driving metastasis. Metastasis is the multistep process by which cancer cells acquire the ability to leave the primary tumor, travel through the circulation, evade the immune system, and establish new tumors in distant vital organs. More than 90% of cancer deaths are attributable to metastasis across all organ sites. Unfortunately, few approved drugs specifically target the metastatic process, and current therapies are insufficiently effective for patients with metastatic cancer.&nbsp;   The Ewald Lab is organized to answer three fundamental questions:   How does breast cancer metastasis work at the cellular level? A diagnosis of metastasis is an empirical observation: breast cancer cells have succeeded in growing in a new organ. We used an integrated series of innovative experiments with 3D cell culture, animal model, and patient tumor tissue to demonstrate: that breast cancer cells express a conserved molecular “tool-kit” as they invade and enter blood vessels,  that they travel through the circulation in adherent groups or “clusters,” that cancer cells co-opt the surrounding normal fibroblasts and immune cells to help them, and that breast cancer cells establish multiclonal metastases that must again change their molecular “tool-kit” to grow in the new organ. Current efforts focus on identifying how metastasis works across the subtypes of breast cancer and on identifying molecular targets for broadly effective anti-metastatic therapies.  How does expression of specific genes enable cancer cells to accomplish distinct steps in metastasis? Modern sequencing methods have enumerated the most common oncogenes and tumor suppressors for the most frequently diagnosed types of cancer. It is much less clear how these molecular changes alter cancer cell behavior sufficiently to drive changes in tissue architecture and function and, ultimately, change patient health. To bridge this gap, we use cutting edge genetic techniques to make defined molecular changes within individual cells or across whole tissues and then conduct an integrated genomic, cell-behavioral, and signaling analysis of the resulting consequences. We use our innovative approaches to define molecular signals that: cause cancer cells to invade, drive uncontrolled cell division, regulate cancer cell adhesion, and allow cancer cells to survive the molecular stresses of travel through the body.  How do interactions between the cancer cell and its “microenvironment” affect metastasis? Breast tumors are not simply a collection of identical cancer cells- instead they contain a complex ecosystem of normal epithelial cells, genetically diverse cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and blood vessels. These cells all communicate with each other and are surrounded by and reciprocally interacting with a microenvironment rich in chemical and mechanical signals. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment is known to change over time during cancer progression and in response to therapy. We, therefore, developed experimental tools to allow us to isolate and control specific cellular, molecular, and mechanical signals in the microenvironment and, thereby, test their influence on metastasis. These experiments have enabled us to demonstrate: that cancer invasion occurs preferentially into areas rich in fibrillar collagen I, that cancer cells collectively sense, respond to, and create microscale mechanical heterogeneity, that fibroblasts regulate the behavior and molecular state of cancer cells, and that cancer cells can co-opt the innate immune response to metastasis through cell surface receptors.&nbsp;   Future Directions   The Ewald Lab is composed of postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduate researchers, and specialized research staff who work in a collaborative and collegial fashion to answer fundamental questions in epithelial and cancer cell biology. Core values of the Ewald Lab include the respectful exchange of ideas, critical and open debate of emerging scientific concepts, personalized career development, promotion of a diverse scientific workforce, and fostering of an inclusive and international scientific community.

Andrew Gordus,Assistant Professor,"Department of Biology,Neuroscience",Understanding how novel and innate behaviors are encoded at the cellular and genetic level,"We live in a dynamic, and at times unpredictable environment. In order to maximize our use of the environment, we must be able to generate both novel and predictable behaviors to engage with the world around us. Our lab is interested in the cellular and genetic mechanisms that drive novel and innate behaviors, and how organisms sense and adjust to environmental variability. To address these issues, we use two model organisms: nematodes and spiders.

The nematode C. elegans has been a useful genetic and developmental tool for understanding fundamental questions in behavioral genetics, and is one of the few animals to have its complete neuronal architecture mapped. By using a variety of genetic tools to manipulate and observe the activity of the neurons in this network, we hope to understand how behavioral novelty arises and adjusts to changing environmental and internal states..

Complex behaviors are often built by a pattern of simpler behaviors. Our lab uses the orb-weaving behavior of the spider U. diversus to understand how neuronal networks can encode a behavior that ultimately results in the elegant geometry of an orb-web. Orb-weavers do not use their vision for web-construction, and are thought to use path integration and spatial memory to map out their environment and influence their decisions. By using a combination of innovative behavioral, neuronal, and genetic approaches, we hope to understand how this behavior is encoded and adjusts to environmental input.",207 Biology East,Biology East,https://gorduslab.bio.jhu.edu/

Andy Feinberg,Bloomberg Distinguished Professor,"Biomedical Engineering,Medicine,Molecular Biology and Genetics,Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center,Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,Biostatistics,Mental Health",,"Understanding how the information in the human genome is utilized is one of the central questions in modern biology. It has become clear that a critical level of gene regulation occurs through the chemical modification of both the DNA itself and the proteins that organize eukaryotic DNA into chromatin. This form of gene regulation, termed epigenetics, refers to cellular “memory” other than the DNA sequence alone, and occurs through mechanisms such as the addition of methyl groups to DNA, as a way of marking specific genes as active or silent. The Feinberg Lab at the Center for Epigenetics has brought together investigators in genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical medicine to develop new technologies to apply to both basic science and population-based epigenetic studies. The center has developed several new genomics, biostatistical, and biochemical methods and is applying them to cutting-edge studies of epigenetic mechanisms and disease research. Some of the projects we’re working on include:
What are the epigenetic drivers of cancer progression? We are determining how mutations in epigenetic modifier genes alter the epigenetic landscape in normal development and cancer, and increase epigenetic plasticity and tumor cell survival.
Can epigenetic alterations in cancer be reversed using novel approaches targeted to large blocks of heterochromatin and/or metabolism?
What are the epigenetic drivers of neuropsychiatric disease and how are they related to brain-region specific developmental epigenetic marks?
What is the relationship between common DNA sequence variants and tissue-specific epigenetic marks in normal development and disease?
How do genome and environment interact to cause disease, and how is this mediated by the epigenome? We are attacking head-on the mechanisms through which environment influences gene function, or “GxE”, focusing on extremely important and contemporary exposures highly relevant to human health: diet, environmental toxicants and their relationship to metabolic disorders and cancer.
What is the mathematical foundation of epigenetic information? We are pursuing our novel idea that genetic variants that control phenotypic variance confer a selective advantage in evolution in an environment that changes, and that the same idea may explain phenotypic plasticity in cancer evolution, with the “hallmarks” of cancer being selected for at the expense of the host. We are developing new information theoretic tools to relate DNA methylation, chromatin structure, and gene sequence to stochastic modeling.","855 N.

Anthony K. L. Leung,Professor,"Molecular Biology and Genetics,Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center,Institute of Genetic Medicine, McKusick-Nathans,Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","My research program focuses on how gene regulation impacts diseases states including cancer, neurodegeneration and virus infection. Recent research focus includes noncoding RNAs, such as circular RNAs and microRNAs, and a druggable protein modification called poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are currently approved by FDA to treat multiple cancers. Though therapeutically important, this modification is understudied partly due to a woeful lack of tools. My team invents  tools to investigate this protein modification, discovering its roles in various RNA processes, RNA virus infection, and the formation of membrane-less organelles. To dissect the underlying mechanisms, our team also use a range of multi-disciplinary techniques from chemical probe synthesis, single-molecule biophysical measurements and quantitative imaging to informatics, genomics and proteomics approaches. Our team is highly collaborative drawing expertise within the lab, the university and around the world. Our goal is to translate our multi-dimensional scientific findings to therapy and diagnostics.","1. RNA metabolism in cancers and viral infection
           MicroRNA literally means short RNAs—though small in size, microRNAs constitute a sizeable class of gene regulators (~2000 in humans), and collectively regulate at least 60% of protein-coding gene expression. On the other hand, circRNAs has the shape of a circle instead of a typical linear string. There are at least 25,000 different circRNAs in humans and one of them has been demonstrated to be critical for developing brain properly. However, much about this class of RNAs is still unknown. Our lab is investigating the molecular mechanism on how ADP-ribosylation regulates microRNA activities and other RNA metabolism. 

2. Develop tools to investigate ADP-ribosylation
         Though ADP-ribosylation has been discovered for over 50 years, it has been challenging to answer mechanistic questions without knowing where the endogenous sites of modification are. Previously, ADP-ribosylation sites could only be inferred by mutagenesis, but the deficiency of ADP-ribosylation in such site-specific mutants can also be explained by secondary effects. Recently, our lab has successfully developed a non-biased proteomics approach to identify ADP-ribosylation sites at all classes of amino acids at the proteome level inside cells.  In addition, our lab also recently developed the first publicly available database of ADP-ribosylated proteins (ADPriboDB) for researchers inside and outside the field to appreciate the complexity and breadth of this therapeutically important protein modification. We are actively developing new tools to investigate this interesting modification that also behaves like a polynucleotide, such as DNA and RNA.

3. ADP-ribosylation hydrolase and RNA viruses
           Our lab recently found that a subset of RNA viruses encodes a protein module called macrodomain that removes (hydrolyzes) ADP-ribosylation. Using Chikungunya alphavirus as a model, we found that mutant viruses abrogating such ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity are not viable whereas mutants reducing the activity have slower replication in mammalian cells and reduced virulence in mice. The macrodomain in the chikungunya virus is similar in other alphaviruses, none of which have a cure or treatment. This specific group of viruses includes the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (which U.S. officials consider a potential bioterrorist threat) and the Mayaro virus, which Scientific American magazine has dubbed the “next Zika” for its pandemic potential. The macrodomain is also similar in all coronaviruses, which includes those that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Finding a treatment for one could greatly improve the ability to treat or prevent the others. Our long-term goal is to understand the fundamentals of how macrodomain works in virus infection and other biological contexts.",615 N. Wolfe Street Room E8632,615 N.

Bertrand Garcia-Moreno,Professor ,"Department of Biology,Department of Biophysics","Experimental and computational studies of protein electrostatics, structure-based energy calculations, ligand-driven conformational transitions","Research in our lab examines the structural and physical basis of solution properties of proteins such as stability, dynamics, and the sensitivity to physical properties of their environment (pressure, temperature, pH, salt). We have active projects in these areas:

PROTEIN ELECTROSTATICS:Many essential biological processes (e.g. catalysis, redox reactions, H+transfer, recognition and binding) are governed by electrostatics forces in proteins. To understand the structural basis of these processes it is necessary to understand how the structures of proteins determine their electrostatic properties. To this end, accurate algorithms for structure-based energy calculations are needed. To guide the development of computational algorithms we study the fundamental physical character of electrostatic effects in proteins with experimental approaches (crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and equilibrium thermodynamics).

ENERGY TRANSDUCING:The property common to all living cells is their ability to convert one form of energy (e.g. light) into another (e.g. chemical bonds).  Proteins are the molecules in charge of biological energy transduction. We study the most important structural motif used for energy transduction, consisting of H+binding groups buried in hydrophobic environments in proteins. The properties of these buried groups are poorly understood, highly anomalous, and they cannot be reproduced with computational models. We are especially interested in experimental characterization of the dielectric response of proteins (i.e. their dynamic response to ionization events) that enables  energy transduction.

PROTEIN ENGINEERING:pH is tightly regulated in physiological environments. Not surprisingly, abnormal cellular pH is associated with many pathological condition, notably cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. With the goal of improving protein therapeutics against cancer we apply fundamental principles of statistical thermodynamics and of classical electrostatics to engineer protein pH switches that respond with a large conformational change to very small changes in pH in the physiological pH range.

EXTREME BIOPHYSICS:Most life on earth exists under extreme conditions of one or more physical variables (pressure, temperature, pH and salt concentration). If life exists elsewhere in the universe, it is likely to exist under extreme conditions as well. We study the molecular mechanisms used by proteins to tolerate extreme environments as well as how proteins evolved in response to changing physical conditions on Earth 4 during billion years of evolution.",002 Jenkins Hall,Shaffer,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/bgme/

Bill Blair,Research Professor,Department of Physics & Astronomy,Experimental astrophysics; supernova remnants; cataclysmic variable stars,"Bill's primary research interests involve objects called supernova remnants (or SNRs for short), which are the expanding gaseous nebulas left over after certain stars come to the end of their evolution and explode as supernovas. Using a combination of imaging and a technique called spectroscopy (where the light from an object is broken up into a spectrum for analysis), Bill's research strives to better understand the chemical abundances and physical processes involved in these objects as they expand outward from the point of the explosion. Bill's research uses both ground-based telescopes and a number of space-based instruments to observe at optical, ultraviolet, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths of light. He not only observes SNRs in our own Galaxy, the Milky Way, but has been instrumental in surveys of nearby galaxies for SNRs.

As an extension of his work on supernova remnants, Bill is also interested in the interstellar medium--the vast regions of not-quite empty space out there between the stars. The FUSE satellite is particularly well-suited for studies of these interstellar regions, and Bill has a number of active projects related to these studies, both in the Milky Way galaxy and in our nearest neighbors, the Magellanic Clouds.

Bill's other area of research delves into understanding the processes involved in close binary stars known as cataclysmic variable stars, or CVs for short. These systems include a normal (but very low mass) cool star in a tight orbit about a very compact companion star called a white dwarf. The stars are in such close proximity that they orbit each other in a matter of a few hours! (Recall it takes the earth a whole year to orbit the sun once!) The strong gravitational attraction of the white dwarf star is such that the white dwarf actually accretes material from its companion, emitting ultraviolet and X-ray light in the process. Bill's research uses ultraviolet spectra to better understand what happens in these unusual stellar binary systems.

While not currently a research area for Bill, he has become active in the areas of global warming, climate change, and related matters. Bill gives public talks in this area, using it as an opportunity not only to engage the public in this important discussion, but also using it as a forum for educating the public on the ways of science.

We use single molecule imaging and spectroscopy technology in live cells, combined with theoretical modeling to extract dynamic biological information. Currently, the lab is working on how cells regulate gene expression. Gene expression has to be tightly controlled both temporally and spatially for an organism to survive and prosper. Dysfunction in local regulation of gene expression is one of the most common sources of developmental and neurodegenerative disease. My laboratory focuses on this fundamental process by visualizing and manipulating the birth, trafficking, translation and decays of single RNA molecules in live cells and tissue. Recently we have developed a method called single molecule imaging of nascent peptides (SINAPS) to visualize translation of single mRNAs. With SINAPS, we can answer biological questions that are intractable before, such as the location of translation, the translation speed of ribosome in cells, the initiation and release rate of ribosome, the relationship between splicing, decay and translation, the effect of untranslated region on translation, etc. We are also interested in local translation in neuronal, such as the effect of synaptic stimulation and dendritic translation, local translation in the axonal growth cone. Besides purely observation, my lab is also focused on developing optic method to manipulate gene expression in live cells.

Bob Leheny,Professor,Department of Physics & Astronomy, Experimental condensed matter physics; disordered materials; soft matter,"I am an experimental physicist at Johns Hopkins University working in the field of condensed matter. Condensed matter physics is the discipline within physics that seeks to explain the material world around us. Our understanding of materials' properties relies crucially on the tools of statistical mechanics that allow us to predict the average behavior of a system with many particles, and the fluctuations about that average, without knowing the detailed behavior of every single particle. Disorder and out-of-equilibrium conditions in a condensed matter system can profoundly affect its behavior, creating novel material properties that pose unique challenges for statistical mechanics. Much of my research at Johns Hopkins has been directed at understanding the physics of disordered and out-of-equilibrium materials. 

Most of the materials on which I focus my research can be described as complex fluids. Complex fluids, such as colloidal suspensions and liquid crystals, are soft materials that possess liquid-like properties but that differ from simple liquids due to internal structure on the nanometer or micrometer scale. Often the properties of complex fluids derive from a delicate balance of interactions at the microscale including entropic, electrostatic, and interfacial forces. The fragile nature of the states that complex fluids assume, as well as their experimental accessibility, make these systems particularly well suited for exploring the consequences of disorder and out-of-equilibrium behavior. Among the disordered systems I have been studying recently include liquid-crystal/colloid composites, gels, and emulsions. 

Much of my research involves x-ray and neutron scattering techniques. I am a frequent user of Sector 8-ID of the Advanced Photon Source and also perform experiments at the National Synchrotron Light Source and at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. I am also a member of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Johns Hopkins. In collaboration with the group of Dan Reich, I have been pursuing a research program that employs state-of-the-art magnetic nanostructure fabrication to create custom-synthesized particles for microrheology. Our strategy is to optimize the probes' geometry as well as their magnetic and surface properties to match specific complex fluid environments and measurements objectives. We have applied this approach to explore the novel elastic forces experienced by anisotropic particles in nematic liquid crystals and to investigate the shear rheology of thin fluid films.",Bloomberg 353,Bloomberg Center,

Health effects of interest include those in the central nervous (e.g., cognitive function, brain structure), peripheral nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems. My research has focused on the health effects of metals (e.g., organic lead, inorganic lead, mercury, cadmium) and various organic compounds (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, hydrocarbon solvents).

The studies are also evaluating whether genetic polymorphisms interact with chemical exposures to modify disease risk, an evaluation of gene-environment interaction. We have used several biologic markers of chemical dose in studying health effects, including some health outcomes never before studied in relation to chemicals.  We have recently found that cumulative lead dose, measuring lead concentration in bone with X-ray fluorescence, is associated with persistent structural lesions in the brain (i.e., smaller volumes of brain structures and increased prevalence and severity of white matter lesions), and these, in turn, are associated with progressive declines in cognitive function as people age.

Vision is your superpower. At a glance, you can tell where you are, what is around you, what just happened, and what is about to happen.  You effortlessly perceive the precise 3D structure of things in your environment, at distances ranging from millimeters to miles.  You know what things are called, how valuable they are, how old or new, fresh or rotten, strong or weak.  You intuit their material, mechanical, and energetic properties, allowing you to anticipate and alter physical events.  You effectively read the minds of other humans and animals based on tiny variations in facial configuration and body pose.  A picture is worth many times a thousand words to you.

All this information seems to exist outside you, immediately and effortlessly available.  Understanding what you see seems trivial—you only have to look at it!  We are so good at vision that we tend not to recognize it as an ability or a process of any kind.  But in fact it is one of the most difficult things the brain does.  Computer vision, even with deep networks, has not even begun to approach the kind of visual understanding that comes so easily to us.  Computers can beat us at math, chess, go, and jeopardy, but they cannot understand the visual world the way we do.

Carl Wu,"Professor, Department of Biology","Department of Biology,Molecular Biology and Genetics","Eukaryotic chromatin structure and function. Biochemistry of nucleosome remodeling and gene transcription, and live cell-single molecule imaging of histone and nuclear protein dynamics","Chromatin architecture and histone dynamics at eukaryotic gene promoters Our lab is interested in understanding the structure and function of chromatin, which has a key role in regulating essentially all chromosome activities. We are currently studying the biochemistry of the conserved histone variant, H2A.Z, which is uniquely incorporated at all eukaryotic promoters and enhancers genome-wide, and has an important role in the control of transcription. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z into nucleosomes and the function of nucleosomal H2A.Z in transcription, we hope to acquire general insights on promoter and enhancer function in health and disease. We primarily use the budding yeast model organism because of its efficient molecular genetics and biochemistry, and evolutionary conservation of fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation. Histone H2A.Z is incorporated into nucleosomes by SWR1, a 14-component, 1-megadalton chromatin remodeler conserved from yeast to humans. SWR1 has two distinct substrates – the canonical nucleosome and the variant H2A.Z-H2B dimer. In the histone exchange reaction, SWR1 mediates ATP-dependent eviction of one nucleosomal histone H2A-H2B dimer coupled with deposition of H2A.Z-H2B, followed by a second histone dimer exchange. Biochemical and structural studies have elucidated how SWR1 captures the H2A.Z-H2B dimer and targets nucleosomes flanking free promoter DNA - both actions primarily through the Swc2/YL1 subunit - but little is known about the molecular mechanism of ATP-dependent histone exchange. To answer this question, we take a multi-disciplinary approach, using the tools of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, combined with structural biology and single-molecule biophysics. In collaboration with T.J. Ha’s lab, we are developing a single-molecule, real-time fluorescence colocalization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach to detect reaction intermediates and measure their lifetimes during histone exchange. We have also embarked on a new venture using live-cell, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to image the dynamics of transcription factors and chromatin-based enzymes such as SWR1. The live-cell approach avoids fixation artifacts, measures the movements of single molecules at high spatiotemporal resolution, and should elucidate how different factors gain access to chromatin in vivo. By comparing diffusive parameters between wild-type cells and those exhibiting defects in the epigenetic landscape, we will gain new insights on the role of chromatin organization and dynamics in transcription. We are additionally interested in the unusual biochemistry of variant nucleosomes at chromosome centromeres. Unlike nucleosome remodeling at gene promoters, nucleosome stability without turnover at centromeres is obligatory for kinetochore assembly during cell division. Yeast centromeres assemble nucleosomes harboring a histone H3 variant called Cse4/ CENP-A. Both Cse4 histone residues and AT-rich centromere DNA composition are important for recruiting CENP-C, a key kinetochore protein, and thus histones and DNA together have a role in centromere specification.",372 UTL,Krieger Hall,

Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only moon having a significant atmosphere in our solar system.  Complex organic chemistry in its atmosphere and surface makes Titan being considered as a potential pre-biology laboratory at the planetary scale. The study of the organic chemistry that occurs on Titan would contribute greatly to our understanding of prebiotic chemistry and perhaps ultimately to an understanding of how life arose on Earth.

Exoplanet Atmosphere: in Quest of Potential Habitable Worlds

Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last two decades, including a sample of rocky worlds in the habitable zones of their host stars. Assessing their habitability will rely on the observation and characterization of the atmospheres of these distant worlds. Laboratory simulations can provide critical information for atmospheric observations of exoplanets. I ran lab simulations to explore a broad range of atmospheres in (Teq< 800 K), smaller (RP < 4.0 REarth) exoplanets by using Planetary HAZE Research (PHAZER) chamber.

Prebiotic Chemistry and Origin of life on Earth

When, Where, and How did life begin on Earth? Most scientists agree over ‘when’: 3.8–4 billion years ago, but there is still so much we don’t know about “where” and “how”. The Miller-Urey experiment supported that more complex organic compounds can be synthesized from simpler inorganic precursors on primitive Earth condition, suggesting that organics for life to begin could be produced in early Earth’s atmosphere. Submarine hydrothermal vents have also been suggested as potential environment for origin of life.

It describes our group and research activities in the area of turbulence, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling. More generally, our group works on the modeling of complexity in fluid mechanics, and applications to environmental flows, CFD, wind energy, and studying turbulence using databases (visit the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases, JHTDB).

We study the fundamentals of turbulent flows, the modeling of complexity in fluid mechanics, and pursue various applications of current interest.

Turbulence is regarded as the main unsolved problem in ""classical physics"". Due to its importance from both practical and fundamental viewpoints, it is a research area of interest to engineers (mechanical, environmental, chemical, civil, etc.), applied mechanicians, physicists, mathematicians, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists. This interdisciplinary flavor makes this an exciting and fruitful field for research. One of our main research goals is to achieve better understanding of how turbulent small-scale motion is related to the dynamics of large-scale motion, with the specific purpose of developing improved modeling tools such as subgrid-scale and wall models for  Large-Eddy-Simulation. This is a highly successful numerical approach to turbulent flow prediction, in which the large-scale vortices are directly simulated, while small-scale motions must be judiciously parametrized.

A major research effort centers on the structure of flow and turbulence in wind farms,  activities mostly funded by the National Science Foundation, such as the past WINDINSPIRE project.  Also, we have developed a new approach to big data in the field of turbulence, wherein entire space-time turbulent fields from Direct Numerical Simulations are made available via Web-services and the notion of virtual sensors. The JHTDB is a public resource that has resulted from this effort, funded by the National Science Foundation. 

We are also applying Large Eddy Simulations to dispersal of oil in the ocean, funded by the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative. We continue to study fundamental aspects of small-scale turbulence via Lagrangian stochastic models and dynamical systems theory tools.  And, Large Eddy Simulations of turbulent flow over various types of surfaces continues to motivate further developments in new wall models and applications.

For example, the lab has recently explored how our minds generate physical intuitions about the world (e.g., how we come to understand that a tower of blocks will topple or a stack of dishes will collapse), and how such intuitions may be underwritten by more basic operations of visual attention and memory. The lab also has interests in long-standing foundational questions about the nature of perception, including how higher-level cognitive factors such as language, desire, emotion, and action can (and cannot) influence what we see.

Our senses do not reflect the external world with perfect fidelity; on the contrary, sensory information is inherently noisy and often ambiguous. How do humans and animals make adaptive perceptual decisions in the face of such uncertainty?

My research addresses this question on two fronts: (a) how the brain combines information from multiple sensory modalities, and (b) how it establishes a level of confidence in a decision. Confidence—the degree of belief that a pending decision will turn out to be correct—is crucial for guiding behavior in complex environments, yet it only recently has become amenable to neuroscientific investigation. We use behavioral assays to ask animal subjects how confident they are in decisions about visual stimuli while recording and manipulating neural activity in sensory and decision-related brain areas. To complement traditional causal methods such as electrical microstimulation and pharmacological inactivation, we have developed and refined optogenetic approaches for activating and inactivating neuronal populations with greater spatial and temporal specificity. The results to date support the idea that confidence arises from the same neural mechanism—bounded evidence accumulation—that explains the choice itself and the time needed to decide.

Our current work brings the experimental and theoretical toolkit of decision making to bear on the more natural case of multiple, time-varying sensory inputs. For example, as an animal moves through its environment, it can use both visual and vestibular cues to judge its speed and direction of self-motion (and confidence therein). Exploring how neural circuits perform this feat, despite the inherent uncertainty of the incoming signals, will shed light on general principles of higher brain function.",Krieger Hall 353,Krieger Hall,https://www.fetschlab.org/

Christopher Honey,Assistant Professor,Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, Computational Cognitive Neuroscience,"Welcome to the Honey Lab in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. We are a group of computational cognitive neuroscientists, investigating how brain regions communicate and how memory arises in hierarchical brain processes.

How do we combine fast and slow information processing to perceive the world?

To understand the world around us, we must combine patterns of information that arrive over multiple time-scales. For example, while having a conversation we continuously perceive not only each spoken word, but also the emerging meaning of that word within a larger sentence, and the meaning of each sentence in the context of the conversation. Data from fMRI and ECoG studies suggest that brain regions are organized in a hierarchy according to the time-scale on which they process information. Regions at the lower levels of the hierarchy sustain representations of sensory information (e.g. word acoustics) over short periods of time, while higher-order regions maintain more abstract representations over seconds and minutes. Thus, our unfolding experience of the world arises from activity within a hierarchical network of functionally specific regions.

Which regions organize the flow of information through the brain, and how?

A typical brain region maintains reciprocal connections with more than a dozen others. Therefore, information can potentially flow in all directions within the brain: downward from the top of the functional hierarchy, upward from the bottom, and also laterally. However, some brain regions are especially effective in organizing and switching the flow of information, as occurs for instance when we switch our attention from what somebody is saying to their facial expression. Our neuroimaging and computational modeling studies suggest that these “hub” regions are found near the top of the functional hierarchy and that they maintain anatomical links across many different areas. The mechanisms are uncertain, but system-specific brain rhythms may be involved in regulating the flow of information. Because brain rhythms can suppress the firing of neurons within a region and also align the firing of neurons in different regions, we study the spatial distribution of brain rhythms and how they change across cognitive states.",Ames 227,Ames ,https://www.honeylab.org/

Christy Thornton,Assistant Professor,"Program in Latin American Studies,Department of Sociology,Population Center,Arrighi Center for Global Studies","Comparative-historical sociology, global inequality and development, labor and social movements, political economy of Mexico and Latin America","My first book, Revolution in Development: Mexico and the Governance of the Global Economy, was published in 2021 by the University of California Press. The book uncovers the surprising influence of postrevolutionary Mexico on the twentieth century’s most important international economic institutions. Drawing on extensive archival research in Mexico, the United States, and Great Britain, Revolution in Development meticulously traces how Mexican officials repeatedly rallied Third World leaders to campaign for representation in global organizations and redistribution through multilateral institutions. By decentering the United States and Europe in the history of global economic governance, Revolution in Development shows how Mexican economists, diplomats, and politicians fought for more than five decades to reform the rules and institutions of the global capitalist economy. In so doing, the book demonstrates, Mexican officials shaped not only their own domestic economic prospects but also the contours of the project of international development itself.

My second manuscript project, “To Reckon with the Riot: Global Economic Governance and Social Protest,” investigates the impact of social protest around the world on international financial institutions (IFIs), asking how widespread protest against policy implemented at the behest of organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization was understood inside those institutions. How did IFI experts and policymakers characterize, narrate, and react to protest against the policies they prescribed, and how did their reactions change over time? And how has social protest historically changed the rhetorical approaches, legitimating strategies, and policy frameworks used by international institutions? Reading against the grain of institutional assertions of apolitical, technocratic expertise, this project examines the ways that street politics have reverberated in the international halls of economic and financial power.",Mergenthaler 521,Keyser Quad,

I became the Principal Investigator (P.I.) of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission in 1996. WMAP was competitively selected as a NASA medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) mission. WMAP was launched June 2001 and its first scientific results were made public in February 2003. WMAP quantified the age, content, history, and other key properties of the universe with unprecedented accuracy and precision. This was recognized by Science magazine as the 2003 ""Breakthrough of the Year.""

Previously I was the Deputy P.I. of the Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) instrument and a member of the Science Team of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. The COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers instrument was used to make the first detection of variations across the sky (anisotropy) of the temperature of the afterglow radiation from the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background radiation.

I participate in NASA's Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA) data center. LAMBDA provides COBE, WMAP, and other cosmological data to the community.

In 2010 I began work on a new experiment funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to test and characterize ""inflation"" theory. It is widely believed that the infant universe underwent a rapid period of exponential expansion called ""inflation"". Many of the predictions of inflation theory have been verified by WMAP and other measurements. An important test remains. Gravitational waves are generically produced by inflation. Some day in the distant future those gravitational waves may be detected. In the meantime, the gravitational waves can be sought by their imprint on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Several research groups are seeking this unique polarization signature of Inflation. Our group is building the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) instrument to search for this faint polarization pattern. We plan to situate CLASS in the Atacama desert in northern Chile.

Some kind of ""dark energy'' is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. The determination of the nature of the dark energy is a major goal of physics and cosmological research. Several groups are building and using instruments to probe the dark energy. My research group at Johns Hopkins is actively engaged in dark energy research and I have long played a leading role in studying the possibilities for a space mission. The Wide Field InfraRed Space Telescope (WFIRST) mission would be capable of several kinds of dark energy observations as well as other valuable astronomical research. The European mission called Euclid is also planning to conduct dark energy research. I am a member of the Euclid Consortium and I am planning to participate in the analysis of Euclid data. I earlier served on a National Research Council committee that recommended to NASA that it provide hardware for Euclid. I am also a member of the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) instrument team. It also has the goal of studying the distribution of dark matter in the universe and to use it as a proble of the dark energy. We have started to build part of the PFS instrument at Johsn Hopkins University. Among other applications, this spectrometer will help to further constrain the geometry of the universe beyond the WMAP constraints.",Bloomberg 209,Bloomberg Center,http://cosmos.pha.jhu.edu/bennett/

I engage these research themes on the register of everyday life, within the scene of the domestic and within kinship relations as they are interpenetrated by state institutions and the pressures of economic deprivation. I have undertaken extensive fieldwork in Santiago, Chile, and more recently have turned to work on North-South Korea. In all of my research projects, I bring close attention to method in anthropology, detail in ethnographic writing, and pursue a rigorous interdisciplinarity in fields ranging from clinical medicine to public health, history of medicine, philosophy, and regional studies. My interest in everyday life and the ordinary has led me to also work at the crossroads of anthropology, philosophy, and literature.

Life in Debt: Times of Care and Violence in Neoliberal Chile (University of California Press, 2012) is based on over a decade of fieldwork in a low-income neighborhood in Santiago, Chile. It explores the slow shifts in subjectivity and small fluctuations of care and neglect in intimate relations as they are interpenetrated by economic precarity, and state programs on poverty, mental health, and human rights.

Seeing like a child: Inheriting the Korean War (Fordham University Press, Fall/Winter 2020) explores how the catastrophic event of the Korean War is dispersed into a domestic life marked by small corrosions and devastating loss. Crossing genres of autobiography and ethnography, I write from the inside of my childhood memories as the daughter of parents who were displaced by war, who fled from the North to the South of Korea, and whose displacement in Korea and subsequent migration to the United States implicated the fraying and suppression of kinship relations and the Korean language. In counterpoint to the project of testimony that seeks to transmit a narrative of the event to future generations, Seeing Like a Child sees the inheritance of familial memories of violence as embedded in the child’s inhabitation of everyday life

Echoes of a Death (manuscript in progress) is based in a low-income neighborhood under police occupation in Santiago, Chile. It follows how the death of a young man at the hands of the police reverberates through specific kinship relations, through the neighborhood, and within state institutions. While the literature on violence in Latin America focuses on the massiveness of violent death in the region, I am interested in what comes to mark the experience of a single death.

Living and Dying in the Contemporary World: A Compendium (University of California Press, 2015, co-edited with Veena Das) is a 45-chapter edited volume that explores the entanglements of living and dying in an ever more interconnected world, across regions and through thematics, including: natality, sexuality, and reproduction; medical, legal, and pharmaceutical spaces; healing: religious and secular bodies; precarious lives; death and dying.

At Johns Hopkins, I am a board member and former co-director of the Program in Racism, Immigration, and Citizenship; a board member of East Asian Studies, the Program on the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, and the Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine.

Some specific examples are briefly summarized below.

Every year a portion of the U.S. corn crop is infected with aflatoxins, a family of potent mycotoxins produced by certain strains of the fungus Aspergillus. In our investigations of this and other fungal toxins great strides have been taken toward making available the key biosynthetic enzymes for more detailed study. Prominent among these are non-reducing Type I iterative polyketide synthases (NR-PKS), a group of polyfunctional proteins of great interest for their synthetic power and biotechnological potential. In the last few years our lab has played a major role in mechanistic and structural understanding of this family of proteins. Two previously unrecognized catalytic domains were identified and dissection and reconstitution (""deconstruction"") experiments have allowed the coordinated roles of all six catalytic domains to be deduced. In conjunction with continuing structural studies, we have demonstrated in domain combinatorial experiments the ability to prepare “un-natural” products and deduced the “rules” of iterative synthesis that make predictable synthesis possible.

The mechanism of ß-lactam formation is central to the question of how penicillin and related antibiotics are formed. We have cloned the gene clusters that encode the enzymes of these biosynthetic pathways, which have opened the way for detailed investigations of their catalytic properties and structures. Of particular interest are the proteins such as ß-lactam synthetase, active in clavulanic acid formation yet entirely distinct from penicillin biosynthesis.  Related proteins have been found to be active in carbapenem biosynthesis. X-ray structures and detailed mechanistic enzymology of both enzymes have opened the way to protein engineering and directed evolution experiments to capture the synthetic power and chiral selection of these enzymes to accept alternate substrates and produce other medicinally-useful products. Important progress has been made recently in applications to clinically important carbapenems. Separately we have isolated a pair of non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases (NRPS) from the nocardicin A producer. A new mechanism of b-lactam formation has been discovered and yet another previously unappreciated NRPS mode of catalysis appears to be acting in monobactam biosynthesis.

In addition, collaborative programs are underway with groups in the Schools of Medicine and Public Health in mycobacterial infections as, for example, tuberculosis, and separately malaria. The former problem is centered on the discovery relatively recently of a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial cell wall cross-linking analogous to the step inhibited by penicillin and other b-lactam antibiotics but carried out by a family of evolutionarily and structurally distinct enzymes. This multi-group project involves in my laboratory structure-based drug design driven by X-ray structures of these enzymes with a select few inhibitors bound. The malaria project involves the isolation, purification and structural characterization of anti-malarial natural products from the microbiome of a non-transmitting mosquito. This project has the potential to lead to new field procedures to combat mosquito-borne disease transmission and/or direct human therapy.",Remsen 252,Remsen Hall,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/townsend-lab/

We have studied in detail the carcinogenic bacterium, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), using this organism as a model for inducing colon inflammation and carcinogenesis. Over time, we identified the B. fragilis toxin gene (bft), purified the protein (BFT) and defined its mechanism of action in vitro. Subsequently, we established in vivo models of ETBF colitis and colon tumorigenesis. Using these models, we identified that ETBF induce selective Stat3/Th17 immune responses in the colon and that these pathways, at least in part, contribute to colon tumorigenesis. Our data were the first to report a Th17 mechanism for inflammation-induced endogenous colon tumor induction; subsequent work by other groups has confirmed the importance of Th17/IL-17 mechanisms in many cancers including human colon cancer. We subsequently turned our attention to identifying bacterial contributions to human colon cancer. This work led us to propose the hypothesis that biofilm-associated colon mucosal pro-carcinogenesis marks an early event in the biology of colonic epithelial cell transformation in a subset of sporadic colon cancers. This hypothesis is now being tested in a prospective NCI-supported study involving 2000 individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy with mechanistic work conducted in germ-free mice. We have extended our work to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) to further test the hypothesis that the microbiota and potentially specific bacterial species contribute to colon carcinogenesis. This work represents the earliest stage of colon polyposis at which microbiota disease associations and mechanisms have been examined to date. Our long-term goal is to devise ways to utilize the microbiota markers to identify and better predict those at risk for colon carcinogenesis.","600 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21287",600 N.

Protein function is dynamically regulated in the cell by the attachment and subsequent removal of covalent posttranslational modifications. Acetylation and ubiquitination both occur in chromatin, the nucleoprotein complex into which eukaryotic DNA is packaged. Acetylation of the histone proteins in chromatin is associated with activation of transcription, whereas ubiquitination can be either an activating or a repressive mark, depending on which histone protein is modified. Ubiquitination of chromatin also plays a role in the response to DNA double-strand breaks, helping to recruit proteins that are required for DNA repair. They are interested in the molecular basis for these events, which ensure the integrity and expression of the genome. They use x-ray crystallography, enzymology, and a variety of biophysical tools to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying these essential cellular processes.

My interdisciplinary research lies at the nexus of infectious disease modeling, health economics, operational and implementation science, and classical epidemiology.  My primary interests are:

(1) Dynamic modeling and economic evaluation of TB and TB/HIV: My greatest research passion is evaluating the implementation and scale-up of TB and HIV control interventions, especially diagnostic and case-finding strategies.  I combine methods from traditional epidemiology, cost-effectiveness analysis, and epidemic modeling with the aim of answering questions of relevance to patients and policy-makers.  I serve on the steering committee of the Gates Foundation-funded TB-Modeling and Analysis Consortium (TB-MAC) and direct two NIH-funded projects related to modeling the scale-up of TB diagnostic tests.  I currently work with collaborators on projects based in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, India, Zambia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. 

(2) Translational epidemiology: I have great interest in creating modeling frameworks that allow decision-makers to translate epidemiological data into effective decisions.  I welcome collaboration from researchers, clinicians, or students having expertise in any field, who hope to create models to translate epidemiological data into meaningful policy, practical, or clinical decisions.

(3) Implementation science: I am interested not only in how interventions operate in idealized settings, but also improving how they are implemented in the real world.  Generally, implementation barriers are greater than theoretical scientific ones; I think it is critical to conduct research that will help us overcome them.

(4) Teaching and mentorship:  These are essential, and often-undervalued, skills in the field of epidemiology.  If our profession is to continue its record of success, I firmly believe that we need to train future leaders how to teach and mentor others, and also to do our best to serve as role models in that regard.","615 N.

In particular, long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse have been implicated in acquisition and extinction of eyeblink conditioning, respectively.  In recent years, Dr. Linden’s laboratory has used both electrode and optical recording in cerebellar slice and culture model systems to explore the molecular requirements for induction and expression of these phenomena. The Linden lab has found that induction of LTP in the parallel fiber synapse requires a presynaptic cascade of Ca influx/adenylyl cyclase I/cAMP/PKA and that its expression is also presynaptic. In contrast, induction of LTD at this synapse is triggered by postsynaptic activation of mGluR1 and AMPA receptors together with Ca influx, resulting in activation of PKC and consequent clathrin-mediated internalization of AMPA receptors.  The lab has also discovered a new form of plasticity, LTD at the climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapse, which was not anticipated in models of cerebellar learning and which appears to share some induction requirements with parallel fiber LTD. They have subsequently expanded analyses to include use-dependent synaptic as well as non-synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar output structure, the deep nuclei.

Derek Schilling,Professor ,"Modern Languages and Literatures,Center for Advanced Media Studies,Program in International Studies", Modern and contemporary French literature; film esthetics and theory; geocriticism; urban and suburban studies,"My scholarship bears primarily on modern and contemporary French literature, with an emphasis on socially conscious novels of the interwar period as well as on the experimental, generically hybrid fictions that have arisen since the 1950s. Central to my concerns as a reader and critic is the dialogue that literature entertains with an evolving spatial imaginary itself correlated to historical transformations of lived and built space. My secondary field is cinema esthetics and the history, ideology, and theory of filmic representation during the celluloid era.

This early-career project led me to investigate more broadly the interrelationship between literary representations and lived space. In my work on modern and contemporary literatures in French, I am particularly interested in the ways in which narratives set up spatials contract with their readers based on various types of local or geographical recognition. How does the novelistic representation of space interact with the coordinates of collective memory or the “image” of a place at a given moment in its socio-historical development? How dense or sparse, how static or dynamic is the image of the diegetic world that we construct out of a text? Is the fact that the theory of fiction has long favored the temporal coordinates of narrative over the spatial ones a function of the ontology of fiction itself, or rather a methodological oversight? What I call narrative geopoetics aims to explore the inner workings of fiction with a mind to the particular ways of worldmaking these creative works instantiate.

Film esthetics and theory form my second field of specialization. The monograph Eric Rohmer (2007) explored the signal esthetic contribution of the French filmmaker (1920–2009) who translated André Bazin’s ontological realist legacy into a controlled yet sensuous approach to mise en scène. In contrast to those New Wave directors who highlighted cinema’s reflexive potential, Rohmer subordinates the telling of the story to the diegesis and particularly to speech as primary catalyst for action. Employing the camera to capture the world without compromising its innate ambiguity, Rohmer evolves a mannered realist style that invests the film image with a luminous transparency bolstered by attention to voices and the acoustical environments that carry them.

Alongside work on the history of cinema esthetics, I take interest in the interactions between filmic representations and socio-cultural phenomena. A series of articles examines several French films of the 1970s that address head-on the legacy of the Algerian War of Independence, by the likes of René Vautier, Yves Boisset, and Laurent Heynemann. Other articles investigate the political imaginary of labor in documentaries on factory work (e.g. Louis Malle’s Humain, trop humain) and on the effects of factory closures since the 1990s on local communities of memory.",Gilman 426,Gilman Hall,

Dimitri Sverjensky,Professor,Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences,Geochemistry; astrobiology; deep carbon cycle,"My current research is devoted understanding how water in the deep Earth has affected the evolution of the planet. My group has developed a novel picture of the role of water in the deep Earth and its influence on the development of the planet and long-term habitability of Earth. I specialize in theoretical geochemical modeling in collaboration with experimentalists and petrologists. Integration of experiments, petrologic data, and theoretical modeling is the key to understanding the evolution of Earth and a basis for investigating other planets.

I am enjoying an experimental and theoretical modelling collaboration with Professor Isabelle Daniel at the Université de Lyon 1, in Lyon, France. This work was initially funded in 2010 by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through the Deep Carbon Observatory, a major international project devoted to studying Earth’s deep carbon cycle. Carbon, a key element for life on Earth, is carried down into the deep Earth by tectonic plates. How it returns from depth back out volcanos has long been a puzzling mystery. Considerable uncertainty also surrounds the question of how much carbon goes into the deep Earth versus how much is returned to Earth’s atmosphere. Isabelle Daniel is a mineral physicist known for her expertise in experiments in the diamond-anvil cell, in which samples of minerals and water can be squeezed to elevated temperatures and pressures mimicking those in the deep interior of the Earth. I contribute expertise in theoretical geochemical modeling of the experiments.

All of this research laid the foundation for me to develop a novel theoretical model in 2014 for the behavior of water in the deep Earth (Sverjensky et al., 2014; Facq et al, 2014; Pan et al., 2013). Using the Deep Earth Water (DEW) model, it appears that water at very high temperatures and pressures plays a key role in transporting carbon on its return from the deep Earth back out through volcanoes. Water thus enables carbon and other chemical elements vital to life on Earth, such as nitrogen and sulfur, to be replenished in Earth’s atmosphere from the deep Earth over geologic timescales. Furthermore, aqueous fluid-rock interactions in the Earth help set the oxidation states of magmas, which determines the redox states of the gases emitted to the atmosphere, and hence the long-term habitability of Earth.",215 & 220 Olin Hall,Olin,

Driving Problem: Build a “description machine” to annotate natural scenes.

Background: Image interpretation, which is effortless and instantaneous for human beings, is the grand challenge of computer vision.  The objective is to build a machine which produces a rich semantic description of the underlying scene, including the names and poses of the objects that are present, as well as “recognizing” actions, interactions and other semantic events.  Mathematical frameworks are advanced from time to time, but none is yet widely accepted or clearly points the way to closing the performance gap with natural vision.

Research Strategy: Efficient search and evidence integration appear indispensable for scene annotation, and my approach is inspired by two facets of human search: divide-and-conquer querying in playing games like “twenty questions” and selective attention in natural vision. The enabling assumption is that interpretations may be grouped into natural subsets with shared features.  We then design algorithms which naturally switch from monitoring the scene as a whole to local scrutiny for fine discrimination, and back again depending on accumulated evidence and its impact on the likelihoods of competing interpretations.

Computational Medicine
Driving Problem: Tailor cancer treatment to an individual molecular profile.

Background: Gigantic amounts of data about abnormal perturbations in biological networks are being collected by sequencing and microarray experiments, enabling the inference of systems-level disease signatures. Cancer is perhaps the prototypical systems disease, and the focus of extensive study in quantitative biology, including developing algorithms to predict disease phenotypes, progression and treatment response for individuals. However, translating these programs into personalized clinical care remains elusive, and in particular mature applications of statistical learning to inference at the patient level remain limited.

Research Strategy: Realizing this agenda requires recognizing and overcoming the two major limitations of current methodology: (i) the “Black box” decision rules which lack the biological meaning and algorithmic simplicity necessary for transitioning into the clinic; and (ii) the absence of biological mechanism, which is necessary for stable model selection, especially given the unfavorable ratio of samples to variables in the current and any foreseeable learning scenario.  Embedding mechanism in the learning framework is then a “win-win” strategy, but requires a close, sustained collaboration between mathematicians and biologists.",Clark 302A,Clark Hall,https://www.cis.jhu.edu/people/faculty/geman/

The repeat-protein folding studies,funded by the NIH (see grant 1R01 GM068462), have involved a series of roughly translationally symmetric proteins that can be fragmented and extended (see below), allowing direct correlations to be made between stability, folding kinetics, and protein structure.      Using variable-length proteins made of identical “consensus”-based repeats, the Barrick lab has been able to apply nearest-neighbor “Ising” models to resolve intrinsic stability from coupling between repeats. This approach is providing a direct experimental quantification of cooperativity in protein folding, an important but difficult-to-characterize quantity.  These studies have also given rise to a more detailed study of consensus stabilization in globular proteins. The Barrick lab has recently had some surprising successes with this approach. Our first success is a consensus homeodomain that is super-stable and binds DNA with 100-fold increased affinity (currently under review at JACS).  We are currently extending methods for consensus sequence design, to better understand why consensus design works, why it sometimes fails, and how improve it. With these insights, we hope to be able to design high-value pharmaceutical and industrial proteins with improved stabilities, solubilities, and shelf-life, and to improve our understanding of the relationships between protein sequence and evolution, stability, dynamics, allostery, and function. Doug has submitted an NSF grant to support this research. The Barrick lab has also had a long-standing project to understand the complex network of interactions that make up the Notch signaling pathway, funded by the NIH (see grant 1R01 GM060001). Notch signaling is a key pathway (see figure below) in human cell fate determination. Notch defects have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer. We use a combination of structural and biophysical techniques, including x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, ITC, cell-culture transcription and ubiquitination assays, and single-molecule spectroscopy to learn how the many conformational transitions, including disorder-order transitions and bivalent binding, lead to a precisely controlled signal response.  Outside the lab, Doug has put significant effort into teaching, and is nearly finished writing a text entitled “Biophysical Chemistry: a Visual Approach"". As with his teaching, this text focuses on using software and physical examples to illustrate complex problems in physical chemistry in an intuitive way, and to give students a hands-on approach to this analysis. The figure below shows a visual representation of understanding how the Boltzmann distribution (C) results from maximizing multiplicity (A) subject to constraints on ensemble size and energy (B).

Neurons transmit information at specialized synaptic junctions, points of contact where action potentials elicit the release of a chemical neurotransmitter. Neurotransmission at excitatory synapses involves the vesicular release of glutamate, diffusion and binding of glutamate to various receptors, and uptake of glutamate by transporters. These transporters are critical for ensuring that receptors are available to bind glutamate during subsequent release events, as well as for limiting receptor activation so that excitotoxic damage does not occur. Transporters may also shape the activation of receptors on a more rapid time scale during synaptic transmission.&nbsp;   Glutamate transporters belong to a multi-gene family consisting of five members: EAAT1 through EAAT5 (“EAAT” stands for “Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter”). EAAT1 and EAAT2 are expressed in glial cells, primarily astrocytes and Bergmann glia. The critical role of these glial transporters has been shown by the abnormal neuronal signaling and profound behavioral consequences observed when their activity is reduced.   We study the properties of these glutamate transporters in expression systems as well as in acute tissue, such as the hippocampus and cerebellum. Glutamate transporters harness the energy stored in the electrochemical gradients for Na+, H+, and K+ to force glutamate into cells against its concentration gradient. Because transport is electrogenic, we can monitor transporter activity using electrophysiological (patch-clamp) techniques. To provide insight into the intrinsic properties of these transporters, we apply glutamate with sub-millisecond resolution to outside-out patches using a piezoelectric bimorph. These studies are combined with whole-cell recordings from visually-identified astrocytes and neurons in acute brain slices to monitor the activity of transporters during synaptic transmission. Through these studies we hope to determine the fate of glutamate after it is released — how far it diffuses, the types and locations of the receptors it activates, and the role of transporters in shaping its spatial and temporal profile in the extracellular space. Because transporters play a critical role in glutamate homeostasis, understanding their function has relevance for numerous afflictions, such as stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease).  Glial cells perform critical functions in the nervous system. They provide the energy necessary to sustain neural activity, they sequester the ions and neurotransmitters released during synaptic transmission, and they form myelin sheaths around axons, allowing the rapid transmission of action potentials over long distances.  Despite the interdependence of neurons and glia, little is known about the pathways used for communication between these two cell types. A related area of research in our lab involves the study of these pathways and their roles in development and synaptic physiology. The recent discovery of glutamatergic synapses between pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the hippocampus has raised many questions about the involvement of these neuro-glial junctions in regulating OPC differentiation, as well as the role of these “progenitor cells” in hippocampal physiology. We are currently studying these neuro-glial synapses though whole-cell recordings from identified OPCs, and dual pyramidal neuron-OPC recordings in hippocampal and cerebellar slices. As glutamate receptor signaling may regulate oligodendrocyte development and thus myelination, these studies may lead to new approaches for stimulating re-myelination following injury or disease.  We also study glial physiology in the cochlea, the snail-shaped sensory receptor organ for sound in the inner ear. We are particularly interested in a population of astrocyte-like supporting cells that surround inner hair cells (IHCs), the sensory receptor cells in the cochlea. IHCs transduce sound-induced mechanical stimuli into electrical signals and activate auditory nerve afferents through the release of glutamate. Supporting cells express the glutamate-aspartate transporter GLAST and are responsible for clearing glutamate at the IHC-auditory afferent synapse. We are interested in further elucidating their role in shaping synaptic transmission in response to sound. We also noticed that these supporting cells are electrically active during cochlear development and determined that they initiate electrical activity in auditory nerves before the onset of hearing. We are currently investigating how this unique form of glia to neuron signaling influences auditory system development, whether defects in supporting cell to IHC communication underlie hereditary forms of hearing impairment, and if similar mechanisms are implicated in the initial stages of sound-induced tinnitus.",WBSB 1001,Wood Basic Science Building,http://bergleslab.com/

Edward Hedgecock,Professor,Department of Biology,Developmental genetics of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans,"Various cells in animals migrate after their birth to distant sites where they divide or differentiate. Germline and gonadal cells, for example, originate separately but move to a common site to form the reproductive primordia. Growth cones migrate along glial or axonal surfaces to bring remote neurons into contact for synaptic communication. We are using genetics and molecular biology to discover and analyze the spatial cues and navigational programs that guide complex migrations during development.

Each cell or axon migration comprises a series of attachments and detachments of motile cells to stationary cells, or extracellular matrix, which support and guide their movements. Some migrations are simple dispersals away from an origin, but most follow elaborate, stereotyped trajectories that presumably require sequential responsiveness to different extrinsic cues (see Figure). To understand directed migration, we must identify the cues provided by substratum cells and establish their spatial distribution, identify complementary receptors on migrating cells and elucidate navigational programs that activate these receptors in proper sequence, and determine how receptor/ligand binding actually steers the leading edge of a cell or growth cone.

Mutants with abnormal cell or axonal trajectories can identify genes involved in the generation or detection of guidance cues. Because of its cellular simplicity and excellent genetics, the free-living nematode C. elegans has proved useful for mutant analyses of developmental processes, including migrations, that depend on interactions between distinct cell types. Nearly 30 genes affecting cell migrations or axon outgrowth have been discovered to date. Some mig genes affect specific navigational steps while others are strikingly pleiotropic. Two such genes have been sequenced thus far; their deduced products are a basement membrane protein and a trans-membrane receptor, respectively.",007 Biology East,Biology East,

Elena Krasnokutskaya,Associate Professor,Department of Economics,"Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconomics, Applied Econometrics","My primary area of research is empirical industrial organization. My research projects typically use new data, a new modeling framework or a new econometric method to understand the functioning of specific markets and to assess the impact of policies and regulations. My research agenda has three main parts with significant interdependence between them. The first part is devoted to the study of public procurement markets which account for a significant fraction of aggregate economic activity and government spending. My research is focused on understanding the economic mechanisms governing the operation of these markets, such as the endogeneity of participation and subcontracting decisions, and on using this knowledge to evaluate the impact of government policies. The second part of my agenda is focused on the analysis of online auction markets which have emerged over the last decade as a major platform for industry procurement. The data generated by online markets possess a number of unique features that have required me to develop a set of techniques that enable the empirical study of these markets. In the third part of my research agenda I study important non-procurement markets that are among those at the forefront of public policy debates, such as the operation and regulation of private pension (social security) systems and the market for auto insurance. As discussed in more detail below, my research on these markets is greatly facilitated by the ability to leverage insights from my other research areas.

My applied research isolates different channels through which new or existing policies affect the market and assesses their overall impact. The methodological contributions of my research address some of the key challenges at the heart of such analysis. They include recognizing and
modeling features of the environment salient to the assessment, establishing identification, i.e., the theoretical mapping between the data and the model components (primitives), and designing an estimation strategy which allows one to obtain consistent estimates of the model primitives
from the available data that are often imperfect and limited in various ways. In several papers I also develop computational algorithms needed to solve and estimate the model. In what follows I describe my research contributions to date and my current projects. Given the significant interdependence between the parts of my research agenda, I have structured the discussion on the basis of shared methodological insights across my research papers.

Selected research accomplishments include:
• A comprehensive effort in the late 1980s to estimate the direct and indirect costs of injury. The Cost of Injury book defined the economic burden of injury and served for many years as the principal resource on the subject for researchers, practitioners and policymakers.
• Widely quoted in support of efforts at regionalization at both the state and national levels, the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma Care (NSCOT) showed that one’s risk of dying from a major trauma was reduced by 25% if treated in a trauma center vs. non-trauma center.
• The NIH-funded Lower Extremity Assessment Project (LEAP) showed few differences in outcome for individuals with major limb trauma undergoing limb salvage or amputation. Instead, it underscored the importance of high self-efficacy, good social support, and low baseline measures of depression, pain and anxiety in predicting good outcome.

Emily Anderson,Assistant Professor,"Department of Classics,Department of the History of Art,Program in Archaeology","Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age art and archaeology, material culture, craft, glyptic, human/non-human relations, the ongoing biographies of ancient forms and materials","Emily Anderson’s research and fieldwork primarily concern the material and visual cultures of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean Bronze Age with a focus on the ways in which objects are involved in the relations, negotiations and unfolding of sociocultural life. Particular studies examine corpora of material that range in context from Early Minoan Crete to the Mycenaean sphere of interaction during the Late Bronze Age. She received her PhD in Archaeology from Yale University (2009), preceded by an MPhil from Yale and a BA with honors in Old World Archaeology and Art from Brown University.

Dr. Anderson’s first book, Seals, Craft and Community in Bronze Age Crete (Cambridge University Press, 2016), examines a group of stamp seals from the transitional Early-to-Middle Minoan period on Crete that are both engraved with the island’s earliest glyptic iconography and fashioned of imported hippopotamus ivory. The book investigates the implications of these novel aspects of the objects, considering how the imagery engraved on the seals developed practically and symbolically, and how that relates to their prominent use of a rare imported raw material. By embedding these extraordinary objects within the broader context of the time, Dr. Anderson further examines how the seals are but one element of a process of social and spatial “incorporation” on the island, as the nature and scale of persons’ relations to one another were fundamentally reformulated. This study consequently considers various dimensions of social experience and action, from fine-scale handwork of semi-itinerant craftspersons to performative displays at public gatherings, from the forging of footpaths linking distant communities to the development of shared symbolic forms.

Anderson’s current book project concerns the engagement of humans and non-humans in Bronze Age Crete and the Aegean. This project focuses on how representational objects can be understood as vibrant animal bodies, animated by their own distinctive dynamisms. The unique physical, material and mechanical qualities of these things contribute to peculiar affordances in their relations with people and environments. The inter-corporealities of human bodies and these object bodies have potentially powerful sensorial, emotional and social dimensions, and constitute vital aspects of people’s actual, embodied relations with non-humans.

Another research project examines the presence of replicas of ancient objects in modern Baltimore during the Gilded and Jazz Ages. Two corpora constitute the core of this study. The first is a collection of plaster casts of classical sculpture commissioned ca. 1879 for the Peabody Institute, one of the nation’s first public cultural centers. Another is a group of reproductions of Minoan and Mycenaean objects produced for Johns Hopkins University’s Archaeological Collection in the early twentieth century. These two groups of objects, which differ in their substance, contexts, color, scale and interactive character, embody developing attitudes toward the classical past in the modern American city. They force us to consider the realities of access to ancient forms and to consider how the re-embodiment and re-contextualization of these forms in the city not only impacted the identity of the modern urban space but also, simultaneously, contributed to the formation of the ancient past itself. 

Dr. Anderson has undertaken research and fieldwork in the Aegean for nearly two decades, focusing on artifact studies, archaeological excavation, survey, and illustration. These projects have ranged in locale from Crete to the Greek mainland, covering periods from the Final Neolithic to the early Classical and centering primarily on the Early–Late Bronze Age.

We approach the problem using both established and emerging animal and in vitro models of infection and relying on pharmacodynamic principles. Our major goal is to identify and optimize new drugs and drug combinations to shorten and/or simplify treatment and restrict the emergence of drug resistance. Over the past 18 years, we have worked with a variety of public and private sponsors and partners to inform the development of a number of new and repurposed drugs, including moxifloxacin, rifapentine, bedaquiline, pretomanid, sutezolid, and linezolid, as well as novel regimens containing these drugs. We continue to refine existing models and develop new models for pre-clinical drug efficacy studies, including murine models of latent TB infection, cavitary TB and an in vitro “hollow fiber” system for studying the pharmacodynamics of new drugs and combinations.

We are applying similar approaches to improve the treatment of Buruli ulcer and other diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria. Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease characterized by enlarging and ultimately disabling skin ulcers caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans and production of its unique cytotoxin, mycolactone. Only in the last two decades has chemotherapy replaced surgery as the preferred therapeutic option, especially for early lesions. However, early lesions are difficult to detect with available diagnostics and the currently recommended regimens of rifampin combined with either streptomycin or clarithromycin for 8 weeks have many drawbacks. We aim to translate advances in the TB drug development space and novel ideas for detection of mycolactone in biological samples to shorten and simplify treatment and improve point-of-care diagnostics. Pulmonary disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus complex, is notoriously difficult to treat, and there are limited tools available for preclinical evaluation of new treatment options. We are working to repurpose existing antibiotics and, with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, to discover new, more effective drugs against these opportunistic pathogens and to develop superior in vitro and mouse model systems for evaluating their activity in novel regimens.","1550 Orleans Street, Room 107, Baltimore, Maryland 21287",1550 Orleans Street,https://nuermbergerlab.com/

Erika Matunis,Professor ,"Cell Biology,Institute for Cell Engineering",Molecular genetics of germ line stem cell function,"Dr. Matunis studies the stem cells that sustain spermatogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to understand how signals from neighboring cells create a local microenvironment, or niche, to regulate tissue regeneration. In the fruit fly testes, germ line stem cells attach to a cluster of non-dividing somatic cells called the hub. When a germ line stem cells divide, daughters are pushed away from the hub and differentiate. The germ line stem cells receive a signal from the niche (or hub) that allows it to remain a stem cell, while daughters displaced out of this niche lose the signal and differentiate. Researchers in the Matunis lab have found many regulatory signals involved in this process using genetic and genomic approaches. The Matunis lab has also found some surprising changes in cell identity that happen after tissues are injured. For example, differentiating cells can revert to stem cells, and quiescent niche cells can transdifferentiate into stem cells.  Stem cells can even switch their sex identity under some circumstances. The Matunis Lab is currently performing single cell RNA-seq on this tissue.  Her team also investigates Leydig cell regeneration in the mouse testis.",Hunterian G11,Hunterian ,http://cellbio.jhmi.edu/people/faculty/erika-matunis-phd

Erin Jimenez,Assistant Professor,Department of Biology,,"  When discussing the use of animal models, their biological similarities are often emphasized, but it is equally true that differences between model organisms and humans can be leveraged for important scientific discoveries. One area where that has become increasingly true is regenerative biology. Zebrafish are highly regenerative and one of the very interesting cell types it can regenerate but mammals cannot is the mechanosensory receptors of the inner ear that detect sound and control balance. These receptors, known as “hair cells,” regenerate completely in zebrafish and other non-mammalian vertebrates after being destroyed or damaged, while in mammals, hair cell death results in permanent hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction. To understand hearing regeneration, it is essential to understand how genes respond to injury and how those responses are controlled in the genome.   To study this phenomenon, research in the Jimenez laboratory is focused on understanding the zebrafish hair cell regeneration program at the regulatory level and delineating the critical epigenetic differences between a regenerating and non-regenerating animal to shed light on potential strategies to “reactivate” hair cell regeneration in mammals.

Erin Rowe,Professor ,"Department of History,Program in Latin American Studies",Early modern Spain; the Mediterranean; saints and sanctity; women and gender,"My research explores the religious culture of the early modern Iberian world, with particular emphasis on theology, race, gender, and visual culture.

My 2019 monograph, Black Saints in Early Modern Global Catholicism, presents the untold story of how black saints - and the slaves who venerated them - transformed the early modern church. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Spanish and Portuguese monarchs launched global campaigns for territory and trade. This process spurred two efforts that reshaped the world: missions to spread Christianity to the four corners of the globe, and the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade. These efforts joined in unexpected ways to give rise to black saints. By exploring race, the Atlantic slave trade, and global Christianity, she provides new ways of thinking about blackness, holiness, and cultural authority. The book analyzes previously unstudied sculptures and paintings of black saints, examines the impact of black lay communities, and excavates controversies unfolding in the church about race, moral potential, enslavement, and salvation. Black Saints has won the the Roland H. Bainton Prize by Sixteenth Century Studies (2020) and the Albert C. Outler Prize by the American Society of Church History (2020).&nbsp;",Gilman 338B,Gilman Hall,

One of the functions studied is selective attention, that is the capability of higher animals to scan sensory input for the most important information and to discard all other. Models of the neuronal basis of visual selective attention are constructed by simulating them on digital computers and comparing the results with date obtained from the visual and somatosensory systems of primates.

Dr. Bloch has drawn on his diverse background to advance a longstanding interest in the interplay between blood transfusion and infectious diseases, particularly in low and low-middle income countries where transfusion-transmitted infection remains a key metric of suboptimal policies and practices. Blood transfusion networks afford invaluable opportunity to study neglected (e.g., Babesia) and emerging infectious diseases (Zika, SARS-CoV2), as donors contribute large volume samples across a diverse geography. Importantly, many —if not most—infectious risks to the blood supply remain neglected (e.g., malaria, bacteria), particularly in low resource settings, whereby research can yield high impact public health intervention. Blood transfusion itself can also be used to contend with emerging pathogens, as illustrated by the use of convalescent plasma to prevent and/or treat COVID-19.

He has a particular interest in babesiosis, a tick-borne parasitic infection that is endemic to parts of the United States (US). Babesia is globally ubiquitous, yet lack of awareness, in part due to historically limited diagnostic tools, has impeded greater recognition of its role in human disease.

Diverse experimental systems are utilized in these studies.

Chromosome - Chromatin: The assembly, architecture and the control of transcription of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus are analyzed by cytological, biochemical and biophysical techniques ranging from in vitro cell culture and light and electron microscopy, through analytical ultracentrifugation and gel permeation chromatography, to x-ray crystallography and microcalorimetry. We have established that the histone ""core"" of the nucleosome is organized as a tripartite protein entity by the assembly of two dimers of H2A-H2B, one on each side of a centrally located H3-H4 tetramer. The contact interfaces of this assembly are considered as regulatory domains in the functional transitions of chromatin and are being probed by chemical, enzymatic and biophysical probes. We determined the crystal structure of the histone octamer to ca. 3Å resolution and the arrangement of its subunits have revealed novel modes for polypeptide assembly (i.e., histone fold, handshake motif) and protein-DNA recognition and binding (i.e., paired element motifs PEMs). The path of the double helix over the histone octamer has been determined and found to be guided by the 12 repetitive PEMs. Using these geometric constraints, a high resolution model for the nucleosome has been obtained and optimized through molecular dynamics simulations in collaboration with Drs. C. S. Tung and A. E. Garcia of Los Alamos. These simulations revealed that the nucleosome fluctuations are dominated by motions in the DNA backbone. The nucleosome is surrounded by a positive ion cloud with an average local density exceeding by a factor of 5-10 the bulk phase ion concentration. We also see high water density at the protein-DNA boundaries, at the DNA grooves and especially between the two apposing gyres of the nucleosomal DNA.

The energetics of the assembly of the nucleosomal components are analyzed microcalorimetrically through collaboration with Dr. E. Freire of the Biocalorimetry Center of this department. The patterns and specificity of protein-DNA interactions are analyzed by chemical, topological and structural methods. Nucleosome reconstitution experiments utilizing core histone subunits (regular and acetylated), transcription factors and specific sequences of circular DNA are in progress.

Gary Ketner,Professor,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,adenoviruses; eukaryotic molecular biology; gene expression; DNA repair; viral genetics; vaccines,"Human adenoviruses serve as one of the primary model systems for the study of eukaryotic molecular biology. For example, RNA splicing was discovered in studies of adenovirus gene expression, adenovirus DNA was the first eukaryotic DNA for which an in vitro DNA replication system was available, and the first described antagonist of apoptosis is an adenovirus protein. Recently, recombinant adenoviruses has also attracted attention as vectors for immunization against diverse pathogens. Research in my laboratory includes projects both on basic adenovirus biology and on the use as adenoviruses as vaccines for diseases that affect the developing world.

Adenovirus biology. All viruses closely regulate viral gene expression. In addition, they commandeer, inhibit, or modify a wide variety of physiological processes that occur in normal cells. The object of these events is to increase the efficiency of virus production, a strategy ultimately reflected in pathogenesis in an infected individual. In the case of adenoviruses, most regulatory genes and genes responsible for modification of host cell physiology lie in portions of the genome expressed early in infection, called 'early regions'. One of the adenoviral early regions is early region 4 (E4), which covers about 3000 base pairs at the right end of the viral genome and expresses at least five regulatory genes. Our particular interest to us is E4 34k, the protein produced by E4 open reading frame 6 (E4 ORF6). E4 34k performs its biological functions as a complex with another adenovirus protein, E1b 55k. Together, these proteins roles in widely diverse processes in adenovirus-infected cells, including the expression of viral late genes, viral DNA replication, prevention of virus-induced apoptosis, inhibition of DNA damage signaling, and inhibition of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. It has been shown recently that the E4 34k/E1b 55k complex mediates at least some of its activities by functioning as the substrate-specificity module of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting a small number of host cell proteins for ubiquitination and degradation in infected cells. Four targets have been identified, most with obvious relevance to known functions of E4 34k. For example, the ubiquitin ligase mediates degradation of DNA ligase IV, which accounts for the inhibition of NHEJ. However, based on the phenotypes of E4 mutants, we believe that other targets remain unknown and we are attempting to identify additional ubiquitin E3 ligase targets by proteomic methods. The results of these studies will provide a more complete understanding of E4 34k function, and may highlight new strategies employed by viruses to co-opt host cell mechanisms for the purposes of the virus.

Adenoviruses as vectors for immunization. Adenoviruses have been used as vectors both for gene therapy and for vaccination in numerous studies in animals and humans. They show particular promise for vaccination. For example, in mice, a single injection of a defective adenovirus expressing a rodent malaria surface protein induces sterile protection in some animals and an overall 93% inhibition in liver stage development (Rodrigues, et al., 1997. J Immunol, 158, 1268-74). Most candidate adenovirus vaccines employ vectors which do not replicate in the immunized person. The immunization regimens envisioned for non-replicating adenovirus vaccines require multiple injection over several months and such vaccines therefore suffer from cost and logistical problems similar to those that hinder use of conventional vaccines in the developing world. In contrast to non-replicating vaccines, replicating (live) vaccines against adenovirus respiratory disease developed and licensed by the United States military in the late 1960s induce high levels of protection after a single, inexpensive oral dose. The object of our vaccine research effort is exploitation of live oral adenovirus immunization technology to immunize against diseases that exact their greatest toll in the developing world, including malaria, cervical cancer caused by HPV, and dengue.

Mosquito transmitted diseases represent some of the world’s most serious public health problems. The current control strategies for these diseases are mostly based on mosquito killing or avoidance, and are insufficient to limit their spread and final elimination.

Our research program is broadly focused on the biology of mosquito vector competence for malaria and dengue. Our long-term goal is to develop novel disease intervention strategies based on blocking the pathogens in the mosquito, and killing mosquitoes. The overarching theme is the reciprocal molecular interactions between the pathogens, the mosquito’s innate immune system and microbiota.

The mosquito has evolved into a powerful biological model for the study of host-pathogen interactions, and how these are affected by the immune system and microbiota. Our research areas comprise several synergistically interacting projects, which combine molecular biology, biochemical, and functional genomic and genetic analyses of mosquitoes and microbes with parasite and viral infection models.

While our main focus is on the basic biology of these systems, our projects also address translational aspects related to their application in innovative vector-borne disease control.","615 N. Wolfe Street, Suite E3630, Baltimore, Maryland 21205",615 N. Wolfe Street,https://www.dimopoulosgroup.org/

The program was initiated in the 1990’s to investigate the genetic etiology of OCD.

In the OCD Family Study (1996-2001), we evaluated over 800 individuals in 153 families. We found the occurrence of OCD to be six times greater in relatives of OCD cases than in relatives of the control group. Other anxiety disorders, especially agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder, also were more prevalent in case families. Segregation analysis provided evidence that genes of major effect are involved in OCD.

In the OCD Collaborative Genetics Study (2001-2007), we directed a genetics study of OCD in collaboration with five other academic centers in the United States. The collaboration diagnostically evaluated and collected DNA samples from over 200 affected sibling pairs, and completed the first large genome-wide genetic linkage scan of OCD. We found evidence of genetic linkage of OCD to regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 15. We also found intrafamilial correlation of factor dimensions, especially hoarding behavior, in OCD families. In addition, we found significant linkage of compulsive hoarding behavior to a region on chromosome 14. We have been following up these findings with fine mapping of these regions and family-based association studies of functional candidate genes. This research has been funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the OCD Foundation, and the James E. Marshall OCD Foundation.

In the OCD Collaborative Genetics Association Study (2007 - 2014), we and our collaborators at five other academic centers are interviewing and collecting DNA samples from 2000 individuals with OCD and their parents. We will conduct a genome-wide association study to identify even smaller chromosomal regions associated with OCD.

Our current research studies are directed towards identifying both rare variants and de novo genetic variants in OCD, by whole and Exome sequencing.

Among the problems to be considered are the origins of complex society in the third millennium B.C. (Early Bronze Age); the collapse of cities and states at the end of Early Bronze; urban regeneration and formation of the Yamkhad state in the early second millennium B.C. (Middle Bronze Age); and incorporation of the region into the Mitannian and Hittite empires in the mid-late second millennium B.C. (Late Bronze).

Gregory Bowman,Professor,"Department of Biology,Department of Biophysics","DNA architecture, chromosome packaging, molecular motors","In many organisms, including humans, DNA is packaged up into thousands (to millions) of tiny cylindrical structures called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes, which consist of a histone core tightly wrapped by ~146 base pairs of duplex DNA, restrict access to DNA, and therefore must be reorganized to allow access to the underlying DNA sequence. Many cellular factors participate in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, and disruptions of many chromatin-regulating factors have been linked to a number of human diseases, notably cancer.

We study a class of motor proteins, called chromatin remodelers, that actively reorganize nucleosomes. Chromatin remodelers are helicase-type motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA. Our overall goals are to understand both how chromatin remodelers work and how they are regulated. Chromatin remodelers have a number of functionally important domains that appear to communicate with the core ATPase motor. We and others are just beginning to understand how the non-ATPase domains guide action of the remodeler toward specific nucleosome substrates, or to produce a specific remodeling outcome.",302 Jenkins Hall,Shaffer,https://pages.jh.edu/bowmanlab/

Gretar Tryggvason,Professor ,"Mechanical Engineering,Institute for Data Intensive Engineering & Science (IDIES)","Multiphase and free surface flows; phase changes, including boiling and solidification; vortex flows and combustion; numerical methods.","Multiphase flows are ubiquitous is Nature and industrial processes. Rain, breaking waves, sprays, bubbly flows, and boiling, are only a few examples. Accurately predicting the behavior of such flows is critical for the air-ocean exchange of heat and mass in climate modeling, for atomization and clean combustion of liquid fuels, for heat transfer in conventional and nuclear power plants, for selectivity in chemical reactions in bubble columns, and many other systems of immerse economic importance. In many cases the flow is well described by continuum theories (the Navier-Stokes equations) but the range of scales for the systems that we are interested in is so large that averaged or reduced order models are used for predictions of realistic systems. Such modes generally include terms that are not known and need to be related to the model variables thorugh closure relations.

Direct Numerical Simulations (or DNS), where fully resolved numerical simulations of systems that are small enough so that all continuum length and time-scales can be fully resolved, but large enough for non-trivial scale interactions to take place, are used to examine the dynamics of well-defined multiphase systems offer the best way to develop closure models for industrial models.

The members of the Computational Multiphase Group have pioneered DNS of multiphase flows, starting with the development of a versatile and numerical method in the late eighties and early nineties. The method combines a relatively standard finite volume flow solver with a front tracking method, where connected marker points are used to track the boundary between the different fluids. The method, with many improvements and extensions, has now been used to examine a range of problems, including bubbles in initially quiescent flows, bubbles in turbulent channel flows, suspensions of drops, collision of drops, electrohydrodynamics of droplet suspensions, thermocapillary migration of bubbles and drops, effect of surfactants on bubble motion, solidification, boiling and many other problems.

We are currently engaged in several studies that address two kinds of questions. What do we do with the results and how do we simulate complex multiphysics and multiscale problems.

For many flows, such as bubbly flows, DNS are now possible for relatively large systems such as hundreds of bubbles in turbulent flows and for a long enough time so that reliable statistical results can be gathered. One of the central question for such systems is the existence of lower order description, either because such descriotions can be used to explain the dynamics or because it can lead to models that can be used to predict the behavior of industrial systems where DNS is impractical. Such models can take several forms, including Two-Fluid models for the average flow and filtered LES like models for the large scale flow. In both cases the averaging/filtering results in unknown closure terms that need to be correlated with known quantities. We are currently exploring various ways to process the DNS date, including using machine learning to find important relationships in the data.

Many natural multiphase problems exhibit a large range of temporal and spatial scales, either because dynamic processes lead to their generations, such as thin films and filaments and tiny drops, or because of the presence of different physical effects that take place on very different timecale, such as mass transfer and reactions in unsteady fluid flow. While adaptive grid refinement is, in principle, able to resolve such processes, the large range scales still results in excessive number of grid points. In many cases the small scale motion is dominated by surface tension and viscosity, resulting in a relatively simple geometry and simple flows that can be described or approximated analytically. We have develop methods to embed such small scale features in simulations of the larger scale motion using semi-analytical description that are solved along with the rest of the computations.",223 Latrobe Hall,Latrobe Hall,https://engineering.jhu.edu/tryggvason/

Madness in the Family examines the centrality of family in providing care and shaping understandings of madness in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Japan. It argues that families mediated between afflicted members and new institutions of state and psychiatry to produce a distinct set of gendered practices concerning care, bodies, and illness that would influence everyday understandings of madness more profoundly than any other competing authority. The book traverses four overlapping sites of encounter: the rural village, farm household, urban marketplace, and courtroom. The sites are both actual places and conceptual spaces where the claims and practices of families interfaced with those of the state, medicine, law, markets, and religion.

My article on the history of gender and the labor of care considers the case of Japanese psychiatric nursing both inside and outside the walls of the mental hospital from the 1880s to 1930s. It explores links between home- and hospital-based care for those considered mad, suggesting that the gender dynamics of caregiving within the home were both replicated and complicated by nursing in hospitals.

My research on the persecution of religious figures across the Japanese empire is currently focused on the case of Okinawan female shamans known as yuta in the early twentieth century.

Epigenetic modifications of DNA and chromatin are important in maintaining gene expression programs and tissue homeostasis. Due to the widespread changes in gene expression in cancers, it is only obvious that the epigenome is highly perturbed compared to normal cells. These epigenetic alterations help maintain aberrant gene expression patterns and thus the altered abnormal cellular state, which characterizes the entire process of cancer initiation and progression. Various forms of epigenetic information, viz. DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosomal positioning and the higher order chromatin organization, are altered in cancers. Our goal is to understand the origin of these epigenetic alterations during normal physiological processes and their roles in initiation and progression. Amongst the normal states in which epigenetic changes evolve are the process of cellular and organismal ageing. Thus, one focus is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying aging and tis impact on the epigenome. To this end we model the early stages of tumorigenesis using an array of systems, including cell lines, animal models and the new ex vivo mini-gut cultures (organoids). Further, we use various whole-genome approaches to map the epigenetic alterations and use computational approaches to analyze the data. Prospective students will have an opportunity to work with any of aforementioned aspects - model systems, genomic profiling of epigenetic information and computational analyses - and contribute to our understanding of tumorigenesis. Specifically, some of the exciting objectives could include:
- Isolating single organoid structures for epigenetic analysis
- Devise efficient ways of infecting organoids for gene knock-down
- Computational analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation datasets
- Generate and test experimental hypothesis
- Finding and discussing relevant research work

Memories are stored ultimately by changing the way neurons convey information. More precisely, they are stored as changes in the function of synapses: the structures by which neurons contact and transmit signals to each other. My laboratory is interested in exploring the cellular and molecular changes that happen at the synapses to allow memory storage.

Combining various techniques, such as electrophysiological recording, biochemical/molecular analysis, and imaging, we are aiming to understand the cellular and molecular changes that happen during synaptic plasticity. It is well established that neural activity can trigger synaptic changes, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are cellular models of learning and memory. However, in addition to LTP and LTD, more global mode of plasticity needs to be in place to provide stability to neural networks. Currently, we are examining molecular and cellular mechanisms of global homeostatic synaptic plasticity using sensory cortices as model systems. We found that loss of vision elicits global changes in excitatory synaptic transmission in primary visual cortex, which is primarily due to regulation of postsynaptic AMPA type glutamate receptors.

Mitochondria are highly dynamic and control their morphology by a balance of fusion and fission. The regulation of membrane fusion and fission generates a striking diversity of mitochondrial shapes, ranging from numerous small spheres in hepatocytes to long branched tubules in myotubes. In addition to shape and number, mitochondrial fusion is critical for normal organelle function. For example, mice that are defective in mitochondrial fusion die during early development while yeast fusion mutants rapidly lose their mitochondria genome and become incapable of oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, mitochondrial fusion also regulates the release of cytochrome C during apoptosis. Therefore, it is not surprising that defects in mitochondrial fusion cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A and autosomal dominant optic atrophy.",119 Hunterian,Hunterian,www.iijima-sesaki-lab.com

Howard Egeth,Professor,"Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,Neuroscience"," Perception and cognition, attention and attentional selectivity, memory"," Research: Perception and cognition, attention and attentional selectivity  The visual world presents far more information to the eyes than we can effectively deal with at any given time. Thus, what we see is determined by what we attend to. Our research examines the factors that determine the focus of attentional selectivity, and also explores the nature of perception outside the focus of attention (i.e., so-called preattentive vision.)  A major theme in our work examines how humans manage to attend to relevant information but also ignore irrelevant information even when it is highly salient. In addition, we are currently exploring the role that learning plays in ignoring distracting information. Recent work from our lab in these areas suggests that inhibition of irrelevant material, rather than enhancement of relevant material is what drives attentional selectivity. Much of this work relies on both behavioral and neuroimaging techniques (especially EEG/ERP), which are conducted in our lab and the EEG/TMS suite within the department.  Many aspects of our work take an interdisciplinary approach to the research process. Therefore, lab members (graduate students and undergraduate researchers) are highly encouraged to build collaborations with other experts at Johns Hopkins University and beyond.  One such successful collaboration examines the factors that enable stimuli to capture attention. For example, stimuli associated with monetary reward have been found capable of capturing attention. We recently found that pictures of energy-dense food can also capture attention (an effect that is eliminated after a subject eats just a small amount of candy). We are currently working with members of the Eating Disorders Group at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and members of the Weight Management Center at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health to further investigate these phenomenon.  Another fruitful collaboration we have is with the Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. This research endeavor explores the cognitive and neural underpinnings of distractor inhibition in people with ADHD. In related work, we are also exploring how multitasking differs in children with autism and the role that attentional mechanisms play in those processes. More specifically, we have noted that children with autism have difficulty doing two things at once, when imitating. We are trying to determine whether this limitation is seated in perceptual processes, control processes or in the motor system. ",Ames 226,Ames,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/egeth/

Howard Katz,Professor ,"Department of Chemistry,Materials Science and Engineering",Nanomaterials and Optoelectronic & Magnetic Materials,"Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers as Semiconductors

After many years working in the general organic electronics field, including synthesizing many molecular solid compounds for use in organic field-effect transistors, the synthesis focus in the Katz group has moved to conjugated and elf-assembled polymers based on aromatic, heteroaromatic, and condensed rings.  Large values of p-type and n-type conductivity have been demonstrated with unusual environmental stability.  Polymers are mixed with specifically matched dopants to increase conductivity and probe doping mechanisms, are characterized in field-effect transistor structures to separate mobility from charge density effects, and implemented for chemical sensing, charge storage, and energy conversion application as described below.

Chemically Sensitive Devices and Systems

Conjugated polymers interact in different ways with small molecules and biomacromolecules.  The binding of different molecules to electronic polymer surfaces changes the charge distribution and local electric fields around them.   This is observable as changes in electrical conductivity and/or the voltage at which a gate electrode can induce higher conductivity in a transistor.  Selectivity in these responses for specific analyte chemicals leads to chemical sensing.  We have recently focused on detection of pollutant gases such as nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and organic solvent vapors in the environment.  Biomacromolecules investigated include glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP), which are biomarkers of brain and neurological injury, and antibodies to them.  New electrochemical methods are used to determine the mechanisms of the responses, and simulations guide the design of sensing circuits based on sensitive transistors.

Dielectric and Charge-Storing Properties of Materials

There are many situations where an insulating polymer, often designated a “dielectric”, plays an active role in an electronic technology.  Besides shielding conductors from each other, they transmit polarizing signals to semiconductor surfaces, adjust the voltage ranges in which semiconducting devices operate, protect devices against very high electric fields, and transduce mechanical into electrical energy, depending on their structure and processing.  We design and synthesize polymer heterostructures with defined charge-storage capabilities and impose electric fields on polymer dielectrics adjacent to organic and semiconducting polymers to maximize the efficiency at which the polymers perform logic operations and detect vapors.  The fundamental characterization of the heterostructures will be relevant to understanding processes in optoelectronic devices as well.

Thermoelectric Conversion and Mechanisms in Organic and Polymeric Materials

There is growing interest in using polymer based thermoelectric materials to convert otherwise unused heat to electricity where mechanical flexibility and conformability are also required, such as on the body and on rounded mechanical parts.  Using these polymers as the basis of composites with inorganic thermoelectrics would provide advantages arising from the generally higher efficiencies of inorganics along with the processing and mechanical attributes of the polymers.  Finally, thermoelectric characterization is a powerful tool for understanding the energy levels at which electronic charges are localized and transported in semiconductors, including conjugated polymers.

Hybrid Nanostructures from Conjugated Cores and Polypeptides

Conjugated molecules and polymers are often organized with aromatic rings stacked so that energy and charge transport among molecules is promoted.  Polypeptides have their own systems of self-organization as has been evolved through biology, with hydrogen bond networks enforcing preferred arrangements.  The synergistic combination of the two kinds of molecular organization, pioneered by Professor J.D. Tovar of the JHU Department of Chemistry, leads to elongated and stable nanostructures in which optical and electronic communication can occur.  We are probing mechanisms by which these nanostructures grow with the best structural specificity, and the ways in which electrical conductivity can be induced in these nanostructures, guided by computational studies of molecular conformations and intermolecular interactions.  We recently discovered an inorganic crystallization templating effect as an additional function of these nanostructures.",Maryland Hall 210,Wyman Quad,https://engineering.jhu.edu/HowardKatzResearchGroup/

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is far and away the most effective treatment for severe depression, however little is known about how it works. Learning more about how ECT works is important for several reasons. It might help us optimize ECT technique that maximizes efficacy and minimizes memory loss associated with the treatment. Understanding the ECT mechanism of action could help guide the development of other potentially efficacious treatments for depression and other conditions, both pharmacologic and somatic. Such treatments ideally would not trigger the cognitive side effects of ECT nor require anesthesia. Lastly, if we knew how ECT worked, it could help shed light on the pathophysiology of conditions treated with ECT.

The antidepressant response to ECT
A key feature of ECT is the speed at which depressed patients respond. Neuronal immediate early genes are rapidly and robustly induced by ECT and other stimuli in rodent models and have been shown to play key roles in enduring forms of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, they represent a mechanism by which a brief seizure could elicit longer-term adaptations in neuronal function that underlie the rapid antidepressant effect of ECT. We have focused on one of these immediate early genes, Narp, which clusters AMPA receptors and is expressed selectively in limbic brain regions regulating mood and motivation. We have found that mice which lack Narp fail to develop expected behavioral responses in standard rodent antidepressant behavioral assays after a brief course of ECT. These mice also fail to develop normal dendritic arborization in the hippocampus following ECT. Ongoing studies are focused on whether Narp knockout mice develop the expected amnesia after ECT, as well as why such behavioral deficits develop in these mice following ECT.

ECT for suppressing intractable self-injurious behavior
About a quarter of individuals with autism spectrum disorder display repetitive self-injurious behavior (SIB) including head banging and self-directed biting and punching. In some patients, these behaviors are extreme and unresponsive to traditional pharmacological and behavioral therapies with devastating consequences for the patients and their families. We have found ECT can produce life-changing results with a greater than 90% reduction in frequency of SIB in patients with the most severe forms of self-injury. However, these patients typically require frequent maintenance ECT (mECT) to sustain the improvement gained during the acute ECT course. Such mECT regimes can be as frequent as one treatment every 5 days. However, ECT is associated with cognitive side effects and the long-term consequences of mECT started as early as childhood in some cases are unknown. Accordingly, we are interested in learning more about how ECT works in these patients and developing alternate forms of brain stimulation which could potentially suppress SIB without the side effects associated with ECT.

To this end, we are using autism-like mouse models which display excessive stereotyped self-grooming. We are evaluating the response of these mice to ECT and to deep brain stimulation (DBS). In one set of experiments, we are characterizing changes in the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the striatum and assessing whether these changes match the ability of ECT to suppress excessive self-grooming in genetically distinct strains of mice. In another set of experiments, we have found that DBS at the subthalamic nucleus suppresses excessive self-grooming. In follow-up experiments, we are utilizing an optogenetics-based approach to determine which pathways mediate the DBS response.",Meyer 7-120,Meyer,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/specialty_areas/brain_stimulation/research.html

The phylum Apicomplexa includes a large number of intracellular protozoan parasites that must live in a membrane-bound compartment in mammalian cells in order to survive. Among these are some notorious human and animal pathogens such as Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, and Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, two leading opportunistic pathogens in immunosuppressive conditions. Apicomplexa infections are wide-spread, life-threatening and still therapeutically challenging.

By entering into the confines of a cell, these parasites assure themselves a ready source of nutrients and protection from immune confrontations. This luxury crucially relies upon the successful entry into a target cell and the avoidance of host cell defenses such as acidification and endo-lysosomal hydrolases. Unarguably, Apicomplexa are highly competent to establish a nonfusogenic parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that provides a balance between the subversion of host defenses and the parasite's anabolic needs. We are studying the strategies used by Apicomplexa to adapt and exploit their mammalian host cells, leading to disease pathology. Because of the abundance of organic molecules within mammalian cells, these parasites have lost many genes required for the biosynthesis of vital components. In return, novel genes promoting host nutrient scavenging have become essential, and constitute a successful scenario for achieving pathogenicity. The original features discovered through the study of intracellular parasitism offer a unique perspective for elucidating basic questions in mammalian cell biology. In many instances, Apicomplexa have challenged dogma thought to be universal in eukaryotic biology.",Room W4307A,Wilmer Eye Institute,https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/w-harry-feinstone-department-of-molecular-microbiology-and-immunology/research-and-practice/labs/coppens-lab

Title 
Undergraduate Student Researcher 
Machine Learning and Signal Processing

Background
During high velocity impact events many materials undergo a failure process known as spalling. The spall strength of a material is often measured during impact tests using Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV), a form of laser interferometry. Recent developments in experimental methods have enabled high throughput testing to the extent that individually processing PDV signals for every test is no longer feasible. There is a significant need to automate PDV spall signal analysis, using either deterministic or data-driven methods. 

Position
In this position the researcher will be responsible for
• Creating artificial signals and generating a training set for machine learning 
• Writing a program to automatically process and analyze signals, either through deterministic or data-driven methods. 
• Conducting error analysis to assess the accuracy of the program. 

Requirements
Strongly recommended
• Knowledge of python
• Experience/coursework related to machine learning
• Experience/coursework related to signal processing

Useful knowledge, but not required
• Neural networks (PyTorch or TensorFlow is an additional plus)
• Cross-correlation or Kalman filtering
• Parallel or GPU computing
• Cloud computing
• Uncertainty quantification
• Cython ",Malone G45,Malone,https://hemi.jhu.edu/

Work in our laboratory attempts to understand the flow of information through the hippocampal formation and the computations performed by the various subfields of the hippocampus and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To address these issues, we use multi-electrode arrays to record the extracellular action potentials from scores of well-isolated hippocampal neurons in freely moving rats. These neurons have the fascinating property of being selectively active when the rat occupies restricted locations in its environment. They are termed ""place cells,"" and it has been suggested that these cells form a cognitive map of the environment (O'Keefe and Nadel, The hippocampus as a cognitive map). The animal uses this map to navigate efficiently in its environment and to learn and remember important locations. It is also hypothesized that these cells play a major role in the formation of episodic (autobiographical) memories. Place cells thus constitute a tremendous opportunity to investigate the mechanisms by which the brain transforms sensory input into an internal, cognitive representation of the world ""out there"" and then uses this representation as the framework that organizes and stores memories of past events.

Example of Research
Parallel streams of processing through the hippocampus. Parallel streams of processing through the hippocampus. The medial entorhinal cortex provides spatial input through the firing of grid cells. The lateral entorhinal cortex provides object and local-cue information. The dentate gyrus and CA3 regions provide a processing side-loop that is essential for such memory functions as autoassociation and object + place (or item + context) configurations, which may be the critical framework for storing episodic memories.",403 Macaulay Hall/337 Krieger Hall,Macaulay,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/knierim-lab/
James Segars,Professor ,Gynecology and Obstetrics,Non-classical Hormone Action; Uterine Fibroids; Endometriosis; Ovarian Disease and Infertility,"This research group conducts clinical research, translational research and some basic science studies related to reproduction and reproductive disorders. The clinical research team conducts both NIH-funded clinical trials and Pharma-sponsored research for the diseases listed below. The translational and basic science laboratory team also focuses on molecular mechanisms of sex steroid action, in addition to studies of reproductive disorders. 

Endometriosis Focus

One in ten women suffer from endometriosis, a poorly understood disease characterized by the presence of glands and stroma located ectopically. Endometriosis has a variable clinical phenotype: deeply invasive disease, ovarian endometriomas and superficial disease. 
Although estrogen-responsive, the disease can be progesterone-resistant in 40% of women. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease phenotypes remain poorly understood and diagnostic and predictive tests are needed.
To advance understanding of this enigmatic disease, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team to uniquely pursue research questions. Our studies focus on the development of non-surgical diagnostic tests and study of the molecular underpinnings of the disease. Our collaborative research will enhance understanding of the pathophysiology and provide for more effective management of endometriosis, especially progesterone-resistant disease. The studies are the first step toward a personalized medical treatment of endometriosis.

Uterine Fibroid Focus
Uterine fibroids affect millions of women in the U.S. Our past research has revealed that cells within uterine fibroids secrete an extracellular matrix — the substance that surrounds the cells — that is abnormal not only in content, but also in structure. Current studies focus on mechanisms causing the altered growth of fibroid cells, which may lead to the development of new, nonsurgical treatment options or preventive therapies for the millions of women at risk for developing fibroids.

Ovarian Disease Focus
Past research has examined the molecular underpinnings of the conditions. In the course of those studies, we cloned the gene BRX, now known as AKAP13, which acts to augment steroid hormone signaling and serves to integrate multiple cell signaling pathways. Our group has developed murine models targeting AKAP13 to further understanding of its role in hormone action in the ovary and uterus. Ongoing projects are focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved and on characterizing the ovarian phenotype of an ovary-targeted AKAP13 knockout mouse.

Identification of Genes Causing Infertility
In addition, the laboratory focuses on identification of genes contributing to reproductive diseases using a multidisciplinary team approach with unique resources at The Johns Hopkins University. The genes responsible for many reproductive diseases have yet to be identified, but advances in assisted reproductive technologies provide opportunities for advancement of knowledge. Identification of causal genes may lead to new understanding and development of new strategies for treatment of reproductive diseases.","Ross Building, Room 624",Steinwald House,http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/gynecology_obstetrics/research/areas/segars_lab.html

James Spicer,Professor,Materials Science and Engineering,"Materials Characterization, Laser-Materials Interactions, Materials for Energy, Structural Materials, and Optoelectronic & Magnetic Materials","Lasers can be used to process materials and create structures that could not be produced using conventional methods. They play a central role in the rapidly expanding field of additive manufacturing and in developing intricate, metamaterial structures that display unusual properties. Spicer’s work in understanding and controlling laser-material interactions is critical to the use of lasers for processing materials and for characterizing a material’s structure and properties. His research involves taking and interpreting measurements remotely (stand-off detection), which leaves the material unchanged, to study how the characteristics of the laser light – wavelength, intensity, duration of exposure – interact with a material and determine how the material responds. His data is providing critical information needed to develop entirely new production methods for materials, including functional, polymer, thin films for packaging and energy applications and non-oxide ceramics for hypersonic missiles.

Recently, Spicer created a new class of photochromic materials with the potential to revolutionize a range of energy production and usage technologies, including photochromic coatings that darken with exposure to sunlight, photocatalytic films that purify water using sunlight, and artificial photosynthetic materials that produce hydrogen using water and sunlight. Spicer led a research team to form complex nanoparticulate structures displaying photochromic behavior in fluorocarbon-based polymers. His team is developing highly scalable, affordable manufacturing methods for these new, functional nanocomposites.

Spicer’s work in areas related to photoacoustics and laser ultrasonic methods has resulted in new approaches for assessing the structure-property relationships of nuclear graphites (synthetic graphite manufactured for use as a moderator or reflector in a nuclear reactor) and is being pursued as the basis for in-reactor inspection systems. He also has applied these methods for medically-related applications involving prosthetics, aerospace applications for assessing fatigue damage in aluminum alloys, microelectronics applications for verifying structures during chip manufacturing, and polymer film characterization for packaging applications.

Through his secondary appointment with The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), Spicer has studied Terahertz interactions with materials, ultrafast interactions with materials, development of the next generation of high-energy laser materials as well as high-temperature coatings for extreme environments. He was involved with the team that helped develop materials for the thermal management system used on the JHU APL – NASA Parker Solar Probe. As a member of Hopkins Extreme Materials Institute (HEMI), Spicer is teaming with others to develop improved methods for dynamically-testing materials using ultrafast-laser, direct-drive methods. These methods permit the study of materials under the highest strain rates achievable under laboratory conditions. From 2002 to 2012, he was Director for JHU’s Center for Materials Sensing and Detection. Under his leadership, a team of researchers from Hopkins, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and SRI International developed advanced, optically-based, chemical-sensing techniques for new detection methods for explosives in the environment, which are used in commercial systems today.",Maryland Hall 101D,Wyman Quad,

Combining cutting-edge technologies from structural biophysics, molecular engineering, and translational immunology, we create new platforms for the development of targeted therapeutics to treat a broad range of immune diseases.

Protein engineering affords researchers the unprecedented capacity to create new molecules with novel and therapeutically useful activities.

Leveraging cutting-edge tools and exclusive expertise in structural biology and molecular design, the Spangler Lab implements a unique structure-based engineering approach to elucidate the determinants of protein activity and inform drug development. 

We are particularly interested in engineering antibodies to bias immune activity for applications in immunological disorders such as cancer and diabetes. For over 20 years, antibodies have served as the most powerful tool in immunotherapy, acting through a range of mechanisms including target protein inhibition, immune cell recruitment, delivery of cytotoxic moieties, and modulation of host response. However, antibody efficacy is hampered by acquired resistance and target mutation, necessitating the development of new molecules that act through complementary mechanisms. Building on biophysical insights and new engineering platforms developed in our group, we discover, deliver, and preclinically evaluate antibodies that recruit novel mechanisms to target immune diseases.",5011 Smith,400 N.

Janice Chen,Assistant Professor,Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences, real-world memory; cognitive neuroscience; temporal structure in cognition,"In the mind, the present moment is a convergence point of two information streams: one, a continuous flow of sensory input from the outside world; and two, a series of elements from our past experiences, i.e., memories. Memories may be triggered by sensory stimuli, they may themselves cue more memories, and they may change the way incoming stimuli are interpreted, all of which become part and parcel of our current experience.

Past information casts an influence across multiple timescales: events that occurred a moment ago, a minute ago, and a day ago may all impact the present. In order to understand how the mind and brain work, we need an account of how memories of past events, across multiple timescales, continuously influence and merge with ongoing perception and behavior.

Studying real memory requires using real stimuli. Scientists often trade realism for control; we use lists or configurations of random items, attempting to isolate selected variables. However, this approach can strip away the very richness and complexity that made memory such a compelling topic in the first place, and cause us to neglect phenomena that emerge only when stimuli are as dynamic and detailed as the real world.

My work aims to understand how we construct and retrieve memories of complex real-world episodes. I use realistic stimuli (such as movies and narratives) and behaviors (such as spoken recall) that contain rich natural semantics and unfold continuously across multiple timescales. Using novel between-brain temporal and pattern analysis methods, I ask how mnemonic and sensory systems operate together dynamically to create the present moment.",Ames 230,Ames ,http://jchenlab.johnshopkins.edu/

Notably, several of the misfolded and insoluble proteins implicated in neurodegeneration are degraded through macroautophagy (or referred to simply as autophagy), a conserved degradative pathway that is essential for protein homeostasis. These observations strongly implicate the broad therapeutic potential for enhancing autophagy in neurodegeneration and in diseases of aging. However, established stimuli for activating autophagy in non-neuronal tissues are ineffective at inducing autophagy in susceptible neurons , thereby limiting the ability to harness autophagy to degrade toxic forms of aggregated proteins.&nbsp;  Rescuing autophagy deficits in diseases of aging and unraveling how neuronal autophagy is restrained promises to unfetter the broad therapeutic potential for enhancing autophagy to rescue proteotoxicity in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. 

To this end, my lab is focused on elucidating the key regulatory mechanisms that selectively modulate autophagy in neurons. Our overall goal is to apply this information in models of neurodegeneration to develop novel therapeutic targets and strategies to rescue autophagy dysfunction and neurotoxicity.

The goal is to recover the linguistic structure and meaning of words, sentences, documents, or whole languages. I regard these as problems of statistical inference.

Inference requires a model: I work to enable more sophisticated modeling. Why is this important? Because difficult NLP tasks will require increasingly nuanced attention to the linguistic phenomena. Ultimately we want broadly competent NLP/CL systems that can consider many aspects of language
at once.

Beyond designing specific probabilistic models of linguistic phenomena, I often develop general modeling techniques—along with new inference and learning algorithms and software frameworks to make such models practical, since complex models present computational and implementational difficulties.

I have been lucky to have strong students as collaborators on many of my papers. Our work ranges across a wide variety of NLP applications, and considers a wide variety of learning settings. Typically these papers include significant empirical validation, which has often raised the state of the art.

The engineering motivation: Computers must learn to understand human language. A huge portion of human communication, thought, and culture now passes through computers. Ultimately, we want our devices to help us by understanding text and speech as a human would—both at the small scale of intelligent user interfaces and at the large scale of the entire multilingual Internet.

The scientific motivation: Human language is fascinatingly complex and ambiguous. Yet babies are born with the incredible ability to discover the structure of the language around them. Soon they are able to rapidly comprehend and produce that language and relate it to events and concepts in the world. Figuring out how is a grand challenge for both cognitive science and machine learning.

The computer science motivation: NLP problems are excellent examples of more general problems in machine learning, combinatorial optimization, declarative algorithms, and data-intensive computing.

The immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 plays fundamental role in this complex process. Studies document that IL-10 levels are linked with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases. Those data have been confirmed in IL-10 deficient mice. A key to understanding this delicate balance is by evaluating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that govern the expression of IL-10. Remarkably, these processes remain poorly understood. Further complicating the issue is the exciting prospect that allelic variants in the genome are likely to regulate disease susceptibility and resistance by influencing the level of expression of a particular gene or gene cluster. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine/cytokine receptor genes is a common theme in the literature yet only a few of these SNPs have been partially characterized in function. My research is aimed at bridging the gap between genetic polymorphism and biological function. I believe this requires a bilateral approach. Accordingly, my work addresses the basic mechanisms of IL-10 gene expression and the application of these data to allelic variation.

The identification of genetic variants may serve as both markers for disease susceptibility and ultimately as targets for therapeutic intervention. There is however, a bottleneck between genetic haplotypes and the characterization of physiological/immunological mechanisms that mediate complex disease phenotypes. Thus, the broad goals of my research program include: (1) elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cell- and signal-specific IL-10 gene regulation, (2) determine how human cell type-specific human IL-10 regulation impacts disease outcomes, and (3) utilize functional genomics to investigate the translation of genetics and disease association data into a mechanistic and functional immunologic context.","615 N.

A prominent representative of a new class of wealthy and powerful donors—the well-connected bishops of Ottonian Germany, Bernward commissioned artworks of extraordinary quality, and in a wide range of media. The densely meaningful paintings of his book sought to build a special relationship with God and to condition how contemporary and future viewers remembered the bishop. In doing so, the manuscript’s paintings raise broader questions about the nature of medieval images, mechanisms of memory, and ideas about spiritual perception around the millennium.  The book's privileging of touch together with sight over other sensory modes is significant and suggests that medieval patrons and audiences engaged with objects in multiple ways that have yet to be fully unpacked. My 2016 article “Le paysage sensoriel de l'église et les images vers 1200"" reads the sensescape of medieval churches through the liturgical commentary of Sicard of Cremona, and I recently gave a paper at Kalamazoo that expanded this inquiry to the writings of Rupert of Deutz and Honorious of Autun. A course I taught in the fall of 2014 (""Inventing the Middle Ages"") helped launch my new book project, which focuses on the collection, reproduction and display of medieval cultural objects in early modern France.",Gilman 389,Gilman Hall,https://johnshopkins.academia.edu/JenniferKingsley

Our recent work on an inherited form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which is caused by mutations in SOD1, has shown that protein misfolding may play a central role in the degeneration of motor neurons. It has become clear that further elucidation of the mechanisms of protein misfolding and quality control in neurons is a critical step toward understanding this form of ALS as well as many other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s. Our goal is to describe at the molecular and cellular levels how specific neurons degenerate, how protein folding and misfolding operate in the cell, and how protective systems fail at disease stages. To dissect the complex processes of neurodegeneration, we have established novel C. elegans and mouse models of ALS, which recapitulate major features of the disease, providing a unique avenue for our research. Using the C. elegans model and forward genetic screens, we are searching for key genes and pathways of neurodegeneration that are conserved in humans. New discoveries of disease genes, such as TDP-43 and C9orf72, are accelerating our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of neurodegeneration. We use molecular and cellular, genetic, and biochemical approaches to elucidate how these genes function normally and how mutations lead to disease. The elucidation may ultimately lead to better treatments of these devastating diseases.","615 N. Wolfe Street, Room E8628, Baltimore, Maryland 21205",615 N.

Joel Andreas,Associate Professor ,"Program in East Asian Studies,Department of Sociology"," Political contention, social inequality, and social change in contemporary China","My research involves the transitions to and from socialism in China. I was drawn to studying China because it was the site of the most radical of the major 20th century socialist experiments. A central interest has been uncovering the reasons why protracted efforts during the Mao era to do away with class distinctions failed. In my current research, while I am continuing to study the social experiments of the Mao era, I am also examining the tumultuous changes taking place in China today. This includes investigating the capitalist transformation of the Chinese economy over the last two decades, which has led to spectacular economic growth, while at the same time transforming China—once one of the world’s most egalitarian societies in terms of income distribution—into a paragon of economic inequality. While I am interested in the rise of new propertied classes, my research has focused mainly on the dislocation and dispossession of workers and peasants through industrial restructuring and the scaling up of agriculture.

My 2009 book, Rise of the Red Engineers: The Cultural Revolution and the Origins of China’s New Class (Stanford, 2009), analyzes the contentious process through which two mutually hostile groups—the poorly educated peasant revolutionaries who seized power in 1949 and China’s old educated elite—coalesced to form a new dominant class. Mao’s attacks on both old and new elites during the Cultural Revolution, I argue, spurred inter-elite unity, paving the way—after his death—for the consolidation of a new class that combined their political and cultural resources. This story is told through a case study of Tsinghua University, which—as China’s premier school of technology—was at the epicenter of these conflicts and became the preferred training ground for technocratic officials, including many of China’s current leaders.

My second book, Disenfranchised: The Rise and Fall of Industrial Citizenship in China (Oxford, forthcoming), recounts the tumultuous events that have shaped and reshaped factory politics in China over the past seven decades. The book develops a theoretical framework consisting of two dimensions—industrial citizenship and autonomy—to explain changing authority relations in workplaces and uses interviews with workers and managers to provide a shop-floor perspective. Under the work unit system, in place from the 1950s to the 1980s, lifetime job tenure and participatory institutions gave workers a strong form of industrial citizenship, but constraints on autonomous collective action made the system more paternalistic than democratic. Called “masters of the factory,” workers were pressed to participate actively in self-managing teams and employee congresses, but only under the all-encompassing control of the factory party committee. Concerned that party cadres were becoming a “bureaucratic class,” Mao experimented with means to mobilize criticism from below, even inciting—during the Cultural Revolution—a worker insurgency that overthrew factory party committees. Unwilling to allow workers to establish permanent autonomous organizations, however, Mao never came up with institutionalized means of making factory leaders accountable to their subordinates. The final chapters recount the process of industrial restructuring, which has transformed work units into profit-oriented enterprises, eliminating industrial citizenship and reducing workers to hired hands dependent on precarious employment and subject to highly coercive discipline. The book closes with an overview of parallel developments around the globe, chronicling the rise and fall of an era of industrial citizenship.",Mergenthaler 554,Keyser Quad,

NMR spectroscopy is particularly well suited to study such problems and its capabilities are still evolving. One area of continued research is centered on making NMR measurements when the protein is slightly aligned relative to the magnetic field. Most prominent among the benefits of this approach is the appearance of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) in the NMR spectrum. These RDCs are relatively easily measured and represent an abundant source of highly precise information on the relative orientations of different internuclear 'bonds' within the molecule. In addition, RDCs exhibit sensitivity to molecular motions on the nsec-msec timescales, during which many functionally important motions occur.

In particular, we want to understand the mechanisms by which conserved small RNAs—such as the endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs—control animal development and mediate the epigenetic inheritance of their silencing signals.

Additionally, we investigate the post-transcriptional regulatory functions of novel and non-canonical RNA-binding proteins throughout development, in multiple tissues, and in response to dynamic environmental conditions.

To achieve these research aims, we employ innovative genetic, molecular, and functional genomic methods, in addition to proteomic, microscopy, and computational methods. Our primary model organism is the nematode C. elegans.

John Toscano,Professor ,Department of Chemistry," New precursors to NO and HNO, NO-releasing materials, the potential role of HNO in the treatment of heart failure","Our research group is largely focused on the exploration of the fundamental chemistry and biology of physiologically important signaling molecules including nitroxyl (HNO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and related species.

HNO has been shown to have biological activity distinct from that of its redox cousin, nitric oxide (NO), and related nitrogen oxides. Much of the recent interest in HNO has been catalyzed by research suggesting that it may be a novel therapeutic for the treatment of heart failure. At neutral pH in the absence of chemical traps, HNO efficiently dimerizes to hyponitrous acid (HON=NOH), which subsequently dehydrates to nitrous oxide (N2O).  Given this inherent reactivity, HNO cannot be used directly; donor molecules are required for the generation of HNO in situ.

Hydrogen sulfide is believed to be involved in a myriad of physiological processes including smooth muscle relaxation and inhibition of inflammation. Recent reports have shown that much of the biological activity associated with H2S is due to its oxidized congeners, namely hydropersulfides (RSSH) and polysulfides (RSSnSR; n ≥1). Hydropersulfides are highly reactive species with poorly understood chemical properties when compared to their thiol counterparts. Recent studies have shown that hydropersulfides are commonly found in vivo as low molecular weight persulfides (i.e., cysteine persulfide, glutathione persulfide) or as modifications on cysteine residues in proteins. Protein hydropersulfides can be made post-translationally following cysteine oxidation or incorporated during translation using cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS). These modifications are expected to alter the activity of proteins depending on the site of S-persulfidation; however, methods to persulfidate specific residues of interest have yet to be developed.

In order to explore the chemistry and biology of these reactive sulfur species we aim to explore:

1. Novel ways to generate hydropersulfides
2. The fundamental properties of hydropersulfides
3. Biochemical effects of hydropersulfides
4. Reagents capable of specific and efficient protein persulfidation",New Chemistry Building 115,3003 North Charles Street,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/toscano-lab/

Jonas Nahm,Assistant Professor,Washington DC,Disruptive Innovation; Economic Development; Globalization; Energy Issues; Environmental Issues; Newly Industrialized Countries; Political Economy & development; Privatization and Private Sector Development,"My research interests focus on the intersection of economic and industrial policy, energy policy, and environmental politics. I study the role of the state in processes of industrial restructuring that accompany policy responses to climate change and clean energy transitions more broadly. My work utilizes clean energy transitions in China, Germany, and the United States to engage two debates in comparative political economy: (1) the role of the state in shaping the international division of labor in highly globalized industries, and (2) sources of state capacity in interest group politics during periods of industrial restructuring.

My book project, titled Collaborative Advantage: Forging Green Industries in the New Global Economy, uses the development of renewable energy sectors to investigate the political economy of innovation and industrial development in highly globalized industries. The manuscript shows that new possibilities for collaboration among firms in the global economy have reinforced national patterns of industrial specialization. In the decades before international economic integration made it easier for firms from around the world to work together on tasks ranging from production to innovation, differences in national capitalisms yielded equally distinct national industrial specializations for production, innovation, and competitiveness. Globalization has since challenged the primacy of nation states by moving beyond their territorial reach many of the activities that now make up the global economy. However, as I show in the book, globalization not only continues to be mediated by domestic institutions, it also causes persistent and consequential divergence of such institutions and national industrial specializations over time.

Joris Mercelis,Assistant Professor,Department of the History of Science & Technology,"History of technology, history of science, business history, scientific photography, corporate science, science commercialization, university-industry relations, scientific entrepreneurship, intellectual property in science and technology, scientific and engineering ethics  ","My current book project, ""The Long Shadow of Kodak: Corporate Knowledge Empires and the Internationalization of Science,"" explores the consequences of the twentieth-century rise to dominance of industrial corporations over entire fields of scientific and technological knowledge production in different world regions. This research concentrates on the photochemical industry, particularly on Eastman Kodak and its main global competitors, and on the influence of these firms on the discipline of photographic science and technology, including its development in academic and government settings. I pay special attention to the internationalization of research and development activities in this field of study, and examine those internationalization patterns in relation to the corporate and military secrecy that affected the production and dissemination of much photographic knowledge.

My other ongoing research interests include the ethics of commercially oriented science and the forms and amounts of resistance that new technologies have generated historically. I have, for instance, recently started a project on the history of advertising in science and engineering, the initial findings of which are presented in a forthcoming journal article in History of Science.

Much of my earlier work has similarly dealt with opportunities and tensions generated by the real or perceived economic potential of technological and scientific knowledge, especially in the field of chemistry. My first book, Beyond Bakelite: Leo H. Baekeland (1863-1944) and the Business of Science and Invention (MIT Press, March 2020), adopts a transatlantic perspective, centered on issues of intellectual property and scientific entrepreneurship, to interpret the transformation of science-industry connections and interdependencies at the time of the second industrial revolution. It demonstrates how Bakelite inventor Leo Baekeland’s gradually acquired skill in crossing boundaries between scientific and economic spheres, with the aim of securing the highest possible level of intellectual property, contributed to his status as “father of plastics.” The expansion and transformation of the science-industry nexus, moreover, also affected the careers and legacies of many of Baekeland’s contemporaries. Finally, the themes of science commercialization and scientific entrepreneurship are also central to two special journal issues that I recently co-edited, “Commercializing Science: Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Academic Scientists as Consultants, Patentees, and Entrepreneurs” (History and Technology, 2017) and “Academic Entrepreneurship and Institutional Change in Historical Perspective” (Management and Organizational History, 2017).

Despite our being much more cognitively sophisticated, we struggle to learn those same rules in a new language – even when being explicitly taught – and still never achieve full mastery.

Nearly one third of open reading frames encode proteins that live in membranes. These membrane proteins are essential for many biological functions including ion transport, molecular sorting, energy transduction, bacterial pathogenesis, and cell signaling. Over half of the drugs on the market today target membrane proteins, emphasizing their medical importance. Paradoxically, very little is known about how membrane proteins attain their native folds and how membrane proteins assemble into molecular complexes. Research in the Fleming laboratory addresses fundamental biological questions concerning the formation of native structures in membrane proteins:  What are the physical principles dictating membrane protein folding energetics in the biological lipid bilayer? What are the roles played by lipids and membrane structure in promoting protein folding? What principles for protein folding are similar between soluble and membrane proteins? How is folding accomplished in the cellular environment? What are the functions of chaperones involved in membrane protein biogenesis?  Although our research is experimentally driven, we also extensively use molecular dynamics simulations and computational kinetic modeling to address these questions. Students joining the lab will have opportunities to learn both. Our experimental tools include an array of biophysical methods including analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, calorimetry, NMR, and small angle scattering.

Kathleen Cullen,Professor,"Biomedical Engineering,Neuroscience,Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","Multisensory integration for action and perception, neural mechanisms of motor learning, neural prosthesis and rehabilitation, computational neuroscience, neuroengineering","The research in Cullen laboratory has three key objectives:

(1) Fundamental research to understand how the brain builds predictive models of the sensory consequences of self-motion. This computation is required to ensure accurate behavior and stable perception in everyday life. Research combines advanced neuronal recording approaches, multi-dimensional motion and virtual reality platforms, and quantification and targeted manipulation of neuronal populations in brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus and cortex.  For example, the SNNL recently discovered how cerebellar neurons selectively encode unexpected self-motion to ensure the maintenance of posture and stable perception. This work advances our understanding how the brain achieves the flexibility required to continuously calibrate relationships between motor signals and the resultant sensory feedback, a computation necessary for our subjective awareness that we control both our actions and their sensory consequences.

(2) Studies of vestibular/balance disorders aimed at understanding how the brain recovers from peripheral vestibular disease and injury. Research in this model is also aimed at optimizing a novel vestibular prosthesis, in collaboration with neurologists, physical therapists and other neuroengineers and neuroscientists. By linking improvements in prosthetic driven behavior to specific changes in neuronal activities at different stages of processing in the vestibular system, the SNNL has establish methods to successively improve the restoration of vestibular labyrinth function in patients. The SNNL is also using the objective assessment differences in the vestibular input experienced by healthy subjects versus patients during typical everyday activities to develop novel rehabilitation and behavioral training treatment approaches.

(3) The development of transformative multichannel recording, quantitative, molecular, and genetic approaches to advance basic and clinical research on the vestibular system and self-motion processing pathways. Experiments combine state-of-the-art molecular techniques with neuronal ensemble recording and optogenetic-based approaches. The aim is to bridge the gap between genes, neuronal circuits, and behavior, to improve the brain’s ability to compensate following sensory loss.",Traylor 501,Traylor,http://cullenlab.jhu.edu/

Katia Consani,Professor,Department of Mathematics," Arithmetic geometry, number theory, non-commutative geometry","My current research interests are in noncommutative arithmetic geometry and focus on the development of new interconnections between the fields of noncommutative geometry and number-theory, also addressed toward the development of a strategy to attack the Riemann Hypothesis.

The field of noncommutative arithmetic geometry originated with the definition, in the early 90's, of the Bost-Connes quantum statistical mechanical system (BC-system) whose partition function is the Riemann zeta function and whose zero temperature vacuum states implement the global class field isomorphism for the field of the rational numbers. In the joint work with A. Connes, we have achieved new fundamental relations of the BC-system with p-adic analysis and the theory of Witt vectors. This research has also determined the development of the archimedean counterpart of the theory of rings of periods in p-adic Hodge theory and the discovery of the arithmetic role played by cyclic homology of schemes to recast Serre's archimedean factors of the Hasse-Weil L-function of a projective algebraic variety over a number field, as regularized determinants.

My research comprehends the development of the notion of absolute geometry with relevant arithmetic contents. The joint development of the study of the adele class space of Q has brought us to establish a correspondence between an algebraic geometric description of this space and its analytic definition. In fact, to link the geometry of this space to the study of the Riemann zeta function, we consider the quotient of the adele class space of the rationals by the maximal compact subgroup of the idele class group of Q. The algebraic geometric space that describes this double quotient is a semi-ringed (Grothendieck) topos whose original definition, the ``Arithmetic Site’’, is given in terms of a topos defined over B, the smallest (idempotent) semifield of characteristic one (our point of view on this construction is well synthesized in this Dialogue with Alain Connes, and in my talk at IHES 2015). After extending the scalars from B to R^max_+ (the multiplicative version of the tropical semifield of characteristic one R_max), one finds the ``Scaling Site’’, whose points are in one-to-one correspondence with the adele classes (of the double quotient). All these geometric constructions are defined over algebraic semi-structures in characteristic one and for this reason we have focussed our research on the development of a general theory of homological algebra in categories such as the category of sheaves of idempotent modules over a topos. The studied prototype being the category of modules over the basic Boolean semifield, understood as the replacement, in characteristic one, of the category of abelian groups. This construction is well described in the Course of Alain Connes at College de France 2016-17 , in my talk at the Conference in honor of Alain Connes 70th Birthday at Fundan University and in the second related talk given by A. Connes.At Shanghai 2017

Due to the absence of a direct algebraic connection between the ring Z of the integers and B, we have turned to the categorical concept of a module and an algebra over the sphere spectrum S, as implemented in the theory of Segal's Gamma-sets, to provide a characteristic free, unifying description of the geometry of the rational primes and the topos description of the (quotient of the) adele class space of Q. This development is explained in our recent papers: ``On Absolute Algebraic Geometry the affine case'' and ``Segal’s Gamma rings and universal arithmetic''.
The ultimate goal is to transplant some of the ideas of A. Weil in number-theory, in his proof of the Riemann Hypothesis for function fields, to the case of algebraic number fields, using methods of noncommutative geometry. A very recent outcome of this research is explained in the paper Weil positivity and Trace formula: the archimedean place and is overviewed in the talk of Alain Connes at the Oberwolfach meeting (June 2020).",Krieger 410B,Krieger Hall,https://math.jhu.edu/~kc/
Katie Hindmarch-Watson,Assistant Professor,Department of History, Modern Britain and the British Empire; urban space; gender and sexuality; labor and technology,"My forthcoming book, Serving a Wired World: London’s Telecommunications Workers and the Making of an Information Capital, explores the entangled histories of gender, labor, sexuality, urban life, and technology in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. It focuses on the development of the British telegraph and telephone networks in order to better understand the cultural impact of telecommunications work and workers on London, the nation, and the empire.

I argue that this period of communications modernization manifested nineteenth century liberal ideologies of efficient information exchange, but that these were mediated by the human infrastructure –telegraphists, telephone operators, and telegraph messengers – who were essential to the new British and imperial communications order. The telegraph and telephone developed as a specialized service industry, whose operating principles emanated out of relationships between elite consumers and ambiguously placed male and female workers. Telecommunications administrators and engineers, using established interactions between master and servant as an imaginative base, created a modern network according to conventional gender perceptions and social hierarchies, envisioning a system of seamless information flow and order. Men, women, and boys accommodated the strict economic rationalities and personalized service demands of telecommunications work and personified the flow of modern high-speed information, but they were not docile workers. Telegraphists, telegraph boys, and telephone operators were aware of their value to modern life, enabling the “freedoms” of others. In their daily engagements with information channeling, these workers make the foci and exclusions inherent to liberalism’s practice visible, and they challenged their marginalized status within the new information order. In resisting work discipline and upending cultural norms they revealed the unruly potentials of modernizing communications networks.",Gilman 318,Gilman Hall,https://history.jhu.edu/directory/katie-hindmarch-watson/

Katya Tsaioun,Assistant Scientist,Environmental Health and Engineering,"toxicology, systematic review, systematic evidence map, reproducibility, research quality,","Toxicology is a scientific discipline that is closely related to pharmacology and overlapping biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine. It involves the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms and environment. Toxicology is replied upon when developing new chemicals (such as medicines, pesticides, food ingredients, etc.) and is used in regulatory approval and market decisions by international regulatory agencies, such as US Environmental Protection Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agencies, European Food safety Authority, etc. Evidence-based methodologies were developed in the field of clinical medicine over the last 3 decades and now are the foundation of evidence-based practice around the world. Application of evidence-based practices, with the systematic reviews as their primary instrument, to toxicology, is a process that was initiated by Prof. Thomas Hartung and colleagues in 2006, and has resulted in formation of Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC: www.EBTox.org) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Now EBTC has a Board of Trustees and a Scientific Advisory Council, and has brought most of the major toxicology stakeholders to work together on bringing the evidence-based principles (transparency, objectivity, consistency, reproducibility) into toxicology. EBTC conducts its work in working groups, which consist of an EBTC project manager and various interested stakeholders performing various tasks in the project.

Kevin Lewis,Associate Professor,Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Planetary geology and geophysics,"Prof. Lewis’s research focuses on the history of Mars. Extensive geological evidence that Mars could have had flowing liquid water in the past makes it a possible place for life to have evolved outside of the Earth. Whether life actually developed on the Red Planet depends on how long this water persisted. As a result, a major focus of Martian exploration has been focused on features which could have been formed underwater. However, Prof. Lewis has championed the idea that periodic “airfall” deposits of volcanic ash (such as that which buried Pompeii) or wind-blown deposits may play a critical role in Martian geology. Two particularly important results were his discovery that the geological feature being explored by the Curiosity Rover is extremely light – suggesting that it was formed by wind rather than under water, and the finding that much of the dust on Mars may have come from a single volcanic eruption rather than being progressively eroded over time. Both of these results have fundamental implications for understanding the history of Mars.",229 Olin Hall,Olin,

Kevin Yarema,Senior Lecturer,Biomedical Engineering,"Biotechnology and clinical aspects of carbohydrate engineering; Genomics and Systems Biology, Immunoengineering, Translational Cell and Tissue Engineering","The surface of a mammalian cell is covered with a layer of complex carbohydrates that are biosynthetically assembled by the glycosylation pathways of the cell. Monosaccharides, the basic “building blocks” used by these pathways, are typically obtained by the cell from external sources such as the diet. In certain cases the glycosylation pathways will also accept novel, abiotic monosaccharide analogs as substrates; the metabolic incorporation of the unnatural analogs into structural carbohydrates endows the cell surface with novel physical and chemical properties (1; see publications list below).

Two projects areas based on this “metabolic oligosaccharide engineering” (aka “metabolic glycoengineering”) technology are underway in our laboratory. In one, the surfaces are mammalian cells are being endowed with unique chemical properties that are complementary to the growth substrate (for example, thiols can be installed in surface sugars, which form high affinity interactions with gold-coated growth substrates (2)).

In ongoing work, the ability of an engineered binding interface to control stem cell fate is being investigated. In a second project, the sugar analogs used in metabolic glycoengineering are proving to have interesting anti-cancer properties, for example they reduce the invasive properties if metastatic breast cancer cells (3). In ongoing work, based on emerging evidence that the hexosamine template provides an attractive scaffold for drug discovery (4), we are investigating the use of this novel class of drug candidates in various aspects of regenerative medicine.

Kirsten Koehler,Associate Professor,Environmental Health and Engineering,exposure assessment; aerosols; air quality; spatial statistics,"As an Associate Professor in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health my goals are to improve exposure assessment methods to inform occupational and public health policy. My research goals involve the use of direct-reading instrumentation to improve spatiotemporal exposure assessment. Direct-reading (i.e. “real-time”) monitors can rapidly assess exposures to various hazards. My Career Development Award involves coupling estimated exposures with a known location to identify occupational sources of these hazards. Contour plots of the hazard concentration over space, known as concentration maps, have recently been used to assess the spatial variability of hazards. Concentration maps have the potential to be powerful because they are easily comprehensible for workers, managers, and occupational/environmental health scientists to locate areas of concern. In the ambient environment, I am interested in spatiotemporal exposure assessment by pairing direct-reading instruments with a GPS unit to apportion exposures to different microenvironments. I am an investigator on a study in which we are using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine whether commuters can reduce their exposure to traffic-related air pollution by changing their route or mode of transportation (driving vs. bicycling). Additionally, I am the P.I. of an award to investigate the indoor exposures for this cohort. While I believe there is great potential for direct-reading instruments to aid in the identification of exposure hazards, it can be dangerous to apply such a methodology without understanding the uncertainties associated with this new form of exposure assessment. My continuing research interests include investigating the use of traditional spatial statistical methods like Kriging and more novel methods employing Bayesian statistics. 

I am also interested in developing novel aerosol samplers to improve the relationship between exposures and health effects. I have investigated two novel, low-cost aerosol samplers in the laboratory. The first used polyurethane foams to mimic the size-specific deposition of aerosol in the human respiratory tract. We expect that estimating aerosol deposition will provide a more biologically-relevant estimate of dose and risk than traditional samplers that estimate aerosol intake. This sampler represents a large decrease in cost of the exposure assessment because the foam substrate is inexpensive and the low pressure-drop through it eliminates the need for costly personal sampling pumps. Future research will deploy these personal samplers in the field and investigate the link between exposure, particle deposition, and dose for airborne heavy metals. Second, I measured the aspiration efficiency of a several typical personal aerosol samplers (i.e., 37 mm cassettes, IOM, button) and a prototype high-flow inhalable sampler in a wind tunnel. This prototype sampler converted a disposable, 37-mm cassette into an inhalable sampler. This inexpensive adaption of the 37-mm cassette can provide a substantial cost savings over commercially available inhalable samplers, such as the IOM, and improve limits of detection for well-controlled, but highly toxic air contaminants.",E6632,Krieger Hall,

Some context-dependent responses may be maladaptive; for example, anxiety may repress the recollection of information under stressful conditions. Others may be adaptive, enabling discretion and choice in the face of risk. More broadly, contextual factors, related to brain state and cost-benefit calculations, weigh on behavioral decisions and can confound the interpretation of self-reported knowledge. Thus, it is crucial to disambiguate the effects of context from knowledge when interpreting performance. We are studying the neural circuits and dynamics that enable learning, with an emphasis on the role of context and brain state. We first aim to gain behavioral control by designing parametric behavioral assays. We then apply the modern tools of neuroscience to monitor, manipulate and model neural networks.

We are interested in understanding how visual information is transformed between processing stages in visual cortex. Early stages of our visual system represent visual stimuli in a pixel-like fashion, akin to the picture format used by a digital camera. This is a complete, general representation of visual information. However, further processing is required to efficiently store complex visual information, and to carry out the complicated functions accomplished by our visual system. Consider object recognition, for example. Changes in position, color or lighting conditions lead to large changes in the physical appearance of an object, and thereby its pixel-level description. Nonetheless, object recognition is largely invariant to these changes. This is achieved by transforming the initial pixel-level representation into a more invariant and efficient object-level representation. These transformations are implemented in a hierarchy of visual areas.

In general, each processing stage in the visual system transforms its input into a more abstract representation to aid visual perception and cognition. My lab is interested in the structure and function of these circuits, both between primary and higher order visual areas, as well as within individual visual areas. We study how visual information is represented at different processing stages to investigate the nature of the transformations occurring in visual cortex. In addition, we are interested in the development of these circuits and their plasticity.

Kyle Cunningham,Professor,Department of Biology,Mechanisms of calcium signaling and cell death,"Calcium signals regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including contraction of muscle fibers, exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters, gene expression, and programmed cell death. Most of the cellular proteins that control or respond to calcium signals are widely conserved in nature and operating similarly in diverse species. A primary goal is to develop a complete understanding of calcium signaling in a simple cell type (the bakers’ yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and to apply this knowledge toward understanding and treating human diseases.

A key target of calcium signals in humans and in bakers’ yeast is a protein phosphatase known as calcineurin. In humans, calcineurin is crucial for the rejection of transplanted tissue and for the abnormal growth of the heart during heart failure. Drugs that inhibit calcineurin, such as Cyclosporin A and FK506, are therefore useful to maintain survival of transplanted tissues but they cannot be used to delay heart failure because the immunosuppressive side effects. To gain better control of calcineurin signaling, we identified a conserved family of proteins that naturally regulate calcineurin (the RCANs). Depending on their level of expression and on their modifications, RCANs can stimulate or inhibit calcineurin function. This feature makes them ideal candidates for tissue-specific tailoring of calcineurin function. Our current research on RCANs focuses on precisely how these proteins regulate calcineurin in human cells and in bakers’ yeast as a model system. The findings have implications for therapies to treat heart failure, organ transplantation, certain cancers, and potentially even Down syndrome (human RCAN1 very likely contributes to several abnormalities associated with trisomy 21).

Calcineurin and its upstream regulators also function in bakers’ yeast and many fungal pathogens of humans to survive our attacks with antibiotics. The typical azole-class antibiotics do not normally kill fungal pathogens, leaving that task to our immune systems. But when fungal calcineurin is blocked with Cyclosporin A or FK506, the azoles cause massive death of fungal cells. By studying fungal RCANs and ion channels upstream of calcineurin, we may identify new proteins that can be targeted for development of non-immunosuppressive fungicidal drugs.

How antibiotics trigger cell death in fungi and how calcineurin prevents it may shed light on a mysterious type of cell death known as necrosis-like cell death. Necrosis-like cell death can occur in bakers’ yeast during their normal mating cycle, suggesting it may be a form of programmed cell death that somehow benefits the species similar to apoptosis in animals. Similar necrosis-like cell death contributes to the activity-dependent degeneration of neurons and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Many other tissues may also be harmed by inappropriate necrosis-like cell death. By exploiting the powerful genetic technologies of bakers’ yeast, we are identifying pro-death genes and regulatory pathways that may be antagonized by calcineurin. Related genes in pathogenic fungi may help them resist fungicidal antibiotics. Related genes in humans might be contribute to tissue damage during stroke, for example, and therefore new medications that target these genes or their products may be useful for controlling a variety of human injuries or conditions.",204 Biology East,Biology East,

    Performance improvements of materials demand broad and predictive capabilities for microstructural control to optimize precipitate and grain morphologies.  Metrics such as specific strength could then be translated into light-weight structures with greater energy efficiency and impact resistance for use in automotive, electronic, and aerospace applications.
    Micro-scale design of precipitate and grain morphologies is a continually evolving aspect of materials science.  Recently, it has been shown that severe plastic deformation (SPD) is a powerful tool for manipulating microstructural evolution; e.g., tailoring fine-scale precipitate distributions in a micrometer-scale matrix.  Compared to conventional heat treatment or hot deformation, a volumetric creation of lattice defects (i.e., dislocations and vacancies) during SPD can play a far more dominant role in controlling the kinetics of precipitation and recrystallization.  However, a clear understanding, especially in light-weight anisotropic alloy systems, such as those based on Mg, is still lacking.
    This effort studies the fundamental science of precipitation kinetics and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) processes during SPD, with consideration to the crystal structure of the alloy system.  Using the low-density Mg-Al system as our model material, wherein Mg-rich Mg-Al has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure which is anisotropic and Al-rich Al-Mg has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is isotropic, provides a systematic comparative template to shed light on defects and their interaction within anisotropic versus isotropic crystal structures.
    Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), a well-known SPD method is used to control the microstructure.  In a mechanisms-driven context, we  examine and learn to control the microstructural evolution, along three primary sub-processes.   We differentiate between grain interior and boundary regions, as well as consider competitive twinning mechanisms when dislocation activity is limited.
    Microstructural characteristics are probed with Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopies (SEM/TEM) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD).  We also intend to link relevant mechanical properties to microstructure, such as microhardness, yield and ultimate strengths in tension and flow strength in compression, respectively.   &nbsp;Research Topic 2:
    Hardening by carbide precipitation to improve steel properties has been used for centuries. Understanding the precipitation process allows greater control over the type and morphology of the carbides and thus leads to more desirable mechanical properties.  Promoting nanoprecipitation in grain interiors while suppressing carbide formation and growth at grain boundaries are two current general strategies designed to meet the simultaneous requirement of high strength without a sacrifice to ductility.
    We use dynamic precipitation to manipulate carbide nucleation and growth and suppress carbide growth at grain boundaries.  More specifically, we precipitation during severe plastic deformation at elevated temperatures to control precipitation kinetics.  We study a lightweight Fe-Mn-Al-C steel system, which is age-hardenable by -carbides.
    ECAE is a severe plastic deformation method for refining the grain size of steels and other materials.  We use ECAE at an elevated temperature to promote dynamic precipitation and control the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the resultant precipitates. Unlike conventional aging which only accesses the thermal energy of the system, this approach relies on another independent variable that can also affect the precipitation kinetics. The plastic strain introduced during ECAE significantly alters the density and distribution of lattice defects such as dislocations and vacancies.  Thus, under ECAE, the distribution of defects is expected to be more uniform throughout the entire bulk at both grain boundaries and in grain interiors.   Ours is a systematic investigation of the relationship between plastic deformation, temperature, carbide type and morphology.",Malone 115,Malone ,

My research projects typically involve review of patients with these complaints, with goal of answering a particular research question.  For example, some projects that students have worked on in the past include:
 - do airway stenosis patients have voice handicap? 
 - do elderly patients have the same range of voice handicap / dysphonia diagnoses as patients who aren't 65+? 
 - do these elderly patients have the same swallowing handicap / dysphagia diagnoses as patients who aren't 65+?  

We have a robust database of patients who are seen in the Voice Center, and retrospective analyses that look at overlap of laryngeal complaints / diagnoses with other medical conditions are a popular research subject - our Division has had students evaluate overlap between laryngeal disease and HIV, laryngeal disease and anxiety/depression, and laryngeal complaints in patients with inflammatory myopathy.  

Beyond this, I'd be happy to discuss any research idea that you are thinking about that concerns voice, swallowing, or laryngeal  disease.  In addition to retrospective chart review, other good student projects involve surveys of current practice in any variety of topics - for instance, we've done survey studies of vocal conservatories on how they teach vocal hygiene and also surveyed otolaryngology residency programs on how they teach laryngeal surgery in a microsurgery lab, and we've used CMS databases to evaluate regional variations in performance of laryngeal stroboscopy.

If you have an idea for a study that you're thinking about, I'd be happy to work with you to refine a study question and a methodology so that we can create a worthwhile, achievable project.  Please reach out to me at LAKST1@jhmi.edu",JHOC 6251,601 N Caroline St,

We are particularly interested in how nucleocytoplasmic transport and RNA processing intersect to regulate the localization and physiological functions of RNA-binding proteins, with a focus on TDP-43.  

Although the causes of ALS and FTD are diverse and only partially understood, approximately 97% of ALS cases and 45% of FTD cases show nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of the essential RNA-binding protein TDP-43. The cause of TDP-43 mislocalization in disease remains unknown, but abundant evidence suggests that TDP-43 disruption is involved in the pathogenic cascade of disease.

Current projects focus on: (1) the mechanism of TDP-43 nuclear export; (2) the role of RNA in regulating TDP-43 localization; and (3) the effect of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation on the function of the nuclear transport apparatus.

To that end, we utilize immortalized cell lines and primary neurons to monitor nucleocytoplasmic transport using automated high-content imaging and confocal microscopy. In addition, we apply biochemical, biophysical, and imaging methods, including RNAseq, proteomics, FRAP, and FRET, to analyze protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions.

In parallel, we are working to identify and test novel therapeutic strategies for promoting TDP-43 nuclear retention in patient-derived neurons, Drosophila, and mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy.",Rangos 233,855 N Wolfe St,https://hayeslab.science/

To address the complexity of social inequality and interactive nature of the factors affecting it at the interpersonal, community and societal levels, my research emphasizes the influence of multiple domains including biology, behavior, physical environment, family, school, and workplace. I test theory-derived hypotheses applying advanced quantitative and computational methods to large-scale, nationally representative panel survey data as well as administrative and big data. Below, I describe my current projects.

1. Understand the Life Course Process of Wealth Inequality

Building on my previous work on wealth inequality (1996 Social Forces; 2004 International Migration Review, 2007 book Color Lines, Country Lines), my research focuses on the life course process of wealth inequality. A current project examines the long arm of student debt for the black-white wealth gap in the United States. The combination of unlimited non-subsidized student loans and the soaring costs of postsecondary education have led to a national student debt crisis. Student debt, rooted in low parental wealth and the need to borrow for human capital investment, may create pathways of uneven wealth mobility leading to wealth inequality throughout the life course. I analyze individual wealth mobility in response to student debt accruement based on large-scale, nationally representative panel data 2014-2019. My estimates suggest that the harm caused by student debt on wealth mobility is much larger than the harm from credit card debt or loss of earnings. Furthermore, the harm is stronger for blacks than for whites.

2. Identify the Latent Structure of Employment Relations

Expanding my previous research on employment inequality (1997 American Journal of Sociology; 2004 Journal of Policy Analysis and Management; 2013 Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies), I am a co-Principal Investigator of a current NSF project to identify the latent structure of employment relations in which employees and employers are embedded. The multidisciplinary team of sociologists, economists and applied mathematicians is developing inferential network models for dynamic employment relations observed in panel survey and administrative data with computational efficiency. We ask: What are the network communities of employment relations? How do these communities differentially shape the precarity of work? Do immigrants displace native-born workers via job mobility? Our data sources include large-scale panel surveys such as Current Population Survey (CPS) over 12 months, Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) over 48 months, and the administrative-based population-wide data, the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) over 80 quarters.

3. Social Inequality and COVID-19 Outcomes

My previous studies on population health (2000 Research on Aging; 2009 International Migration Review paper; and 2018-2021 publications based on collaborative research on health) prepared me to engage in research on social inequality and COVID-19 outcomes. There has been an increasing awareness that social factors may drive racial disparities in pandemic outcomes and exacerbate the pandemic in the United States. One project examines whether residential racial segregation may be constraining capacities for social distancing thus leaving African Americans potentially more exposed to contracting COVID-19. The paper (published in 2021) suggests that African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.

4. Social Factors and Consequences of Accelerometry Physical Activity

Objective measures of health behaviors such as physical activity via wearable devices are a significant advancement in the study of social factors and consequences of physical activities. I have been working with biostatisticians to apply data science methods to social science studies of wearable device data. Our team’s first publication (forthcoming) asks: How do occupations determine physical activity among regular daytime workers in the United States? How large a share of physical activity difference between two occupations is attributable to differences in occupational tasks, relative to workers’ demographic, health preconditions, and socioeconomic attributes? We provide answers and evidence using wearable accelerometry data on a nationally representative sample of regular day-time full-time working-age adults during work hours. Our decomposition analysis yields insights into the occupational determinant of the volume and bouts of physical activity at work.",Mergenthaler 509,Keyser Quad,

As the Principal Investigator of the Data and Analytical Coordinating Center for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), Dr. Jacobson provides epidemiologic expertise in the conduct of the study, with particular attention to the standardization of study protocols and the design of nested studies. Dr. Jacobson chairs the MACS Data Working Group and represents CAMACS in the Malignancy Group of the Clinical Working Group and participates in the MACS Executive Committee. In addition, she provides epidemiologic, methodological and analytic support to the investigators of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), and to those involved in the mulicenter cohort study of kidney disease in children (CKID). Dr. Jacobson analyzed the timing of infections with HIV-1 and HHV-8 for progression to Kaposi's sarcoma [J Infect Dis 2000;181:1940-1949].

Dr. Jacobson is also investigating the use and impact of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART), in the context of cohort studies. In one paper, Dr. Jacobson demonstrated the dramatic decline of Kaposi's sarcoma in the HAART era; a similar immediate effect on the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was not observed [JAIDS 1999;21:S34-S41]. In another paper, Dr. Jacobson demonstrated that the heterogeneity of using antiretroviral therapies differs according to disease stage [J Clin Epidemiol 2001;54:149-156]. Dr. Jacobson also showed that those starting HAART with <200 cells/µ have the equivalent progression to AIDS as those with approximately 300 more cells in the nautral history era [Am J Epidemiol 2002;155:760-770]. This compliated historical and prospective data provided methods for using biomarker data to established treatment effectiveness. She provides epidemiologic expertise to the analyses of HIV effectiveness, long-term use and outcomes, including behavior related to HAART. Taking advantage of her expertise in epidemiologic methods, Dr. Jacobson instructs doctoral students in the application of these methods in the formation and review of research proposals.","615 N.

Lisel Hintz,Assistant Professor ,Washington DC,Turkey; Ethnic & Nationalist Conflict; Foreign Policy; International Relations; Social Movements & Collective Action; Strategic and Security Issues,"I am fascinated by issues of identity politics, authoritarian consolidation, and the politics of resistance - and particularly how these intersect with popular culture and other forms of media. My regional focus is on Turkey and its neighborhood relations, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. My 2018 book from Oxford University Press, Identity Politics Inside Out: National Identity Contestation and Foreign Policy in Turkey, examines how Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP) used foreign policy gambits to weaken its domestic obstacles and open up space for disseminating its own Ottoman Islamist understanding of Turkish national identity. 

My current book project, under contract with Cambridge University Press, examines state-society struggles over identity in Turkey through the lens of popular culture. My recent BJMES article explores pop culture as a vernacular platform of resistance against the Turkish government's increasing authoritarianism. I preview both these works for a wide audience in a recent Washington Post article exploring how two rap videos galvanized Turkey's embattled opposition around issues ranging from increasing violence against women to environmental degradation to apathy. I also discuss these dynamics on a panel on art and authoritarianism in Turkey with one of the video's creators, rapper Sarp Palaur (aka Şanışer).

Turkey is a culturally vibrant and intellectually puzzling state, from aspects of civil-military relations to ethnic and gender politics to regional (in)security. While a traditional Western ally, Turkey is an increasingly erratic actor at home and abroad, most visibly in Syria and Libya. Understanding its domestic and foreign policies is vital, and demands innovative forms of analysis that can be communicated to academic audiences, policy communities, and university classrooms. With this aim, I speak and write widely on Turkey’s relations in its complex neighborhood as well as with the US and the EU, the Syrian refugee crisis, Kurdish and Alevi issues, and the ruling AKP’s increasingly authoritarian grip on Turkish politics and society.

","The goal of my research program is to answer a fundamental biological question: how is the genome properly interpreted to coordinate the diversity of cell types observed during neuronal development? We are focused on the acquisition of specific cellular identities in neuronal development and identifying the molecular determinants responsible for proper brain development. Using novel experimental approaches for the enrichment and purification of specific neuronal cell types, and  recent technological advances in single-cell RNA sequencing, we can discover and explore the cellular factors that contribute to neuronal cell fate decisions during mammalian brain development. We use these approaches to establish high-resolution time courses of neuronal differentiation and maturation. Much of our work is focused on the 'noncoding genome' and in particular, a specific class of molecules known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs represent a recently-formalized class of RNA molecules with established roles in differentiation, cell fate specification, apoptosis, and various disorders. The flexibility of RNA as a functional substrate, the observed tissue and cell type specificity of these molecules, and their abundance and exquisite spatio-temporal regulation in the developing brain suggest that these genes are uniquely poised to contribute to the observed heterogeneity of the mammalian brain. My group is interested in the mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate target gene expression in the context of neuronal differentiation, their coordinate interactions with regulatory protein complexes, their association with neurodevelopmental disorders, and their functional roles in establishment and maintenance of specific neuronal phenotypes",MRB449,Miller Research Building,http://www.gofflab.org/

M. Ali Khan,Professor ,"Department of Economics,Arrighi Center for Global Studies","Mathematical Economics, Economic Theory, History of Economic Thought, International and Development Economics","I continue to be conflicted by the qualitative-quantitative divide in what the French call les sciences humaine et sociales: the consonance and the dissonance between the languages of mathematics and those of the everyday. This divide can perhaps also be expressed as a conflict or a compromise between two movements: an upward movement characterizing mathematical economics whereby  a loose everyday intuition can be given a precise formal meaning, one that may or may not be refutable with statistical data; as opposed to  a downward movement characterizing applied theory (in the modern vernacular) whereby the hypotheses and the consequences of a  theorem can be interpreted, described  and pushed further in everyday English usage with or without statistical data.  

With this preamble, let me say that I continue to pursue interests in economic interaction over time and with uncertainty, as formalized in Walrasian general equilibrium supplemented by von-Neumann and Ramsey, and the broader interests of Paul Samuelson; and thereby in contexts in which the tension between the personal and the impersonal, and the meaning of information   can be interrogated. Interests  in models with a single agent, be he/she representative or not, as well as those with a finite number and a continuum, situations in which an individual agent is ""numerically negligible"" but is nevertheless influenced by actions, or summary statistics of actions, of all other agents in the society or collectivity, a game, of which the individual is part,  and where individual and social outcomes are uncertain.  These interests, in so far as they crystallize in problems of  family, education, population and the environment,  have led me to consider the robustness of disciplinary boundaries, and more broadly, to the relationship between economic development and cultural change. To me, this subsumes the question of how markets handle, or fail to handle, basic (positive versus normative (?)) issues of resource allocation; and has thereby led me to the theorists of the Scottish Enlightenment, to the  American transcendentalists, and to historians of art.

My interests in literature and  epistemology are complemented by those in mathematics, where I work with methods of nonstandard analysis (Loeb spaces), nonsmooth analysis and optimization (Mordukhovich-Ioffe cones), chaotic dynamics and stochastic processes (law of large numbers with a continuum of random variables).",Wyman Park 528,Wyman Park Building,

The incredible complexity of biological systems derives from the high degree of interactions amongst their constituent components. As such, the cell is often described as a complex circuit consisting of an interacting network of molecules. A key component of these networks are protein switches that serve to couple cellular functions. A switch changes its activity state (the output) in the presence of a biomolecular signal (the input). Examples of natural switches include allosteric enzymes which couple effector levels to enzymatic activity and ligand-dependent transcription factors that couple ligand concentration to gene expression. The ability to create switches comprised of any desired input and output functions would enable the rewiring of the cellular circuitry to our own design and has tremendous potential for developing novel molecular sensors, selective protein therapeutics, and as a tool for elucidating molecular and cellular function.

Our directed evolution strategy for switch construction involving the recombination of genes encoding the prerequisite input and output functions for the switch has proven very successful. We have created ligand-activated enzymes with up to 600-fold changes in enzyme activity in response to the presence of a ligand and developed switches in which a cancer marker triggers prodrug activation. Our current research efforts are divided between seeking an understanding of switch mechanisms and applying our techniques to create switches for applications.

Protein evolution (funded by NSF-MCB)

The fitness landscape model, as first conceptualized by John Maynard Smith in 1970, is a landmark concept for the fields of molecular evolution and macromolecular structure and function. The model imagines evolution as a process by which a sequence moves by mutations across the fitness landscape. The nature of the fitness landscape fundamentally shapes evolution. Using TEM-1 β-lactamase as a model gene, we are building a comprehensive and detailed maps of the fitness effects of mutations. These experiments have brought insight into the determinants of protein mutational effects, the interactions of mutations, the origins of the genetic code, the determinants of protein evolution rates, and natural evolutionary mechanisms.

How does developmental experience affect the human mind and brain? What is the role of experience in structuring concepts of events, objects and mental states? How are such abstract concepts implemented in neural circuits? Our lab investigates these longstanding philosophical puzzles using the methods of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.

We study the origins and structure of human cognition by comparing the minds and brains of people with different developmental experiences.

Cortical Plasticity
To examine the effects of nature and nurture on the human brain, we compare the minds and brains of sighted, congenitally blind and late-blind individuals. Areas of the primate occipital lobe are called “visual cortex” because in sighted people they respond almost exclusively to light. One line of work examines the acquisition of novel functions by visual cortex in blind individuals. In people who are blind, occipital cortex responds to touch, sound and even language. One of our goals is to uncover the cognitive functions that are supported by the occipital cortex in blind people. Are these functions similar to vision? Are they related to the function of nearby cortical tissue? Do the functional subdivisions within occipital cortex mirror organization elsewhere in the brain? We also work with blind and sighted children to study the time-course and mechanisms of cortical plasticity. Visual cortex plasticity provides a window into how genes and experience sculpt cortical function during development.

Conceptual Development
A second line of work examines how experience contributes to concept formation. We use behavioral and neural measures to study concepts of events, objects and mental states in blind individuals. For example, are there differences between blind and sighted people’s concepts of sight perception (e.g. the meanings of sight verbs such as “stare” and “glance”). What do blind adults know about events that could only be experienced through sight such as “sparkling” and “flashing?” How do blind children acquire such information?",Ames 225,Ames,https://bednylab.com/

As a cardiac physiologist and redox biologist, research in my laboratory is focused on elucidating sex-specific, redox-dependent differences in healthy, diseased, and aged hearts with the ultimate goal of identifying novel, cardioprotective signaling pathways for reducing ischemic injury and cardiac aging. The female heart, which we have shown in seminal studies to be naturally protected from ischemic injury in pre-clinical models, is a primary interest of ongoing studies in my research group. Recently, we discovered a novel, sex-dependent role for ADH5 and formate in ischemia-reperfusion injury in male and female hearts and are working to understand how ADH5 and formate confers protection from ischemic injury in order to inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to combat ischemic heart disease. Additionally, emerging evidence supports a role for environmental factors in cardiovascular disease development and we have additional interest in elucidating the sex-specific impact of environmental factors on the heart from development through adulthood, with a current focus heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium and lead. This work aims to determine how environmental factors drive cardiac pathology to ultimately inform effective sex- and population-based preventative strategies, which is critical since extreme weather events fueled by climate change are mobilizing high levels of heavy metals in our environment.  To conduct research in these areas, our laboratory utilizes a number of physiological approaches to assess myocardial/cardiomyocyte function and pathology in tandem with innovative strategies to investigate redox-based protein modifications and metal accumulation in the heart with mass spectrometry.

Mark Van Doren,Professor,Department of Biology,Germ cell development and gonad formation,"Research in our laboratory focuses on the early development of the primordial germ cells and gonad. Germ cells are the only cells that contribute to the next generation of a species, and so an organism’s primary goal is to ensure that these cells are successful. The interactions that germ cells have with somatic cells within the gonad are critical for their proper development. Germ cells play an important role in human health, and improper germ cell development can lead to infertility or the formation of germ cell cancers. Despite the importance of the germ cells, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms controlling their development.

We have chosen to study germ cell development in Drosophila to take advantage of the many genetic, molecular and cell biological tools available in this system. Many of the same developmental issues are faced by germ cells in a wide variety of species, and different organisms are likely to solve these problems in similar ways. Once we gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling germ cell development in Drosophila, we can then apply this knowledge to germ cell development in other species.

We are also studying gonad sexual dimorphism using Drosophila. We have found that the somatic cells of the gonad are already different in males and females at the time of gonad formation, and that these somatic cells direct regulate proper male or female development of the germ cells. Furthermore, genes that are required for proper sex determination in humans also appear to play similar roles in Drosophila. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms that control gonad sexual dimorphism, and determining whether these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved.

Marshall Shuler,Associate Professor ,"Neuroscience,Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences (IBBS)","Systems, Cognitive, Computational Neuroscience; Neural Circuits, Ensembles, Connectomes","The Hussain Shuler lab seeks to understand the learning algorithms and representational architectures the brain uses to produce adaptive behavior. In particular, we study the domain of time-investment problems, where time must be spent to gain future reward. Temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) is an example of a learning algorithm commonly used to explain human and animal reward learning and decision-making, while the state space to which TDRL is applied is the representational architecture. We use quantitative behavioral tasks, in vivo electrophysiology, imaging of neuromodulator release, and causal manipulations to test and develop better normative models and understand their neural instantiations. We also address these questions in models of Alzheimer’s disease to understand how neurodegeneration, especially of the cholinergic system, impairs decision-making.&nbsp;   Outcome Prediction   Humans, like other animals, decide between courses of action based on their expected outcomes. Yet, how expectations of outcomes of given amounts, delays, and valence are learned and produced by the brain in response to predictive events is little understood. This ability of the brain to model how much and when to expect rewards or punishments (outcome prediction) features prominently in reinforcement learning theory. However, neither our understanding of how a neural circuit can produce, nor how it can learn to produce, outcome prediction signaling to inform decision-making behavior is satisfactory.  While it is commonly held that ‘higher-order’ brain regions are responsible for imparting behavioral significance on sensory input, Dr. Hussain Shuler demonstrated that pairing visual stimuli with subsequent reward leads to the emergence of reward-timing activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). Subsequent work in the lab has provided evidence that this activity is generated within V1 itself, informed by acetylcholine and produced by circuit motifs of inhibitory interneurons. Visual cortex projects directly to the dorsal striatum, motivating our study of outcome prediction in the visual corticostriatal circuit and its role in decision-making.  Representational Architectures  A learning rule, like the one used in TDRL to assign value to states, is just one component of a learning agent. The specific form and connectivity of a state space, the representational architecture, has a profound impact on the behavior of the agent. We use modeling, quantitative behavior, and electrophysiology to study how representational architectures are implemented in the brain.  Alzheimer’s Disease  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) degrades the ability to learn and make appropriate decisions. As the basal forebrain cholinergic system is highly susceptible to amyloidosis, one neuromodulator that is especially implicated in cognitive decline caused by AD is acetylcholine, which is essential in many forms of learning and memory. While higher-order brain areas associated with decision-making have been intensively investigated as they relate to AD, recently there has been a call for greater focus on the consequences of AD in sensory- and motor-related areas. Observation of neural activity from the visual cortex and the dorsal striatum reveal visually-cued timing activity to expected reward, providing a window into the process of transforming visual cues into reward-seeking motor action. By combining a mouse model of AD that develops amyloidosis with a line that affords a means to control and functionally image cholinergic axons, the effects of amyloidosis on cholinergic-dependent interval timing activity can be assessed, neurally and behaviorally, compared to that caused by the normal course of aging, and rescued by augmenting cholinergic signaling of reward using a novel optogenetic intervention.",WBSB 914,Wood Basic Science Building,https://sites.google.com/site/marshallshuler/

Ideal treatments for these diseases would eliminate all autoreactive immune cell clones without affecting protective immune responses. Our goal is to develop such antigen-specific precision immunotherapies. 

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and related T cell therapies have  revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers over the past decade and can achieve sustained cancer-free remission. Our lab uses these tools (i.e., CRISPR HDR-based cell engineering) to reprogram autologous T cells to allow them to specifically eliminate autoreactive cells – while preserving normal immune cell populations. These therapies have the potential to fundamentally change the treatment of patients with autoimmune and rheumatic diseases— by introducing new drugs that can control autoimmunity without increasing the risk of infection. 

We are passionate about developing this new generation of cell- and protein-based therapies for autoimmune and rheumatic diseases. We believe that antigen-specific immunotherapies are going to transform the health of patients living with rheumatic disease over the next two decades, and offer a future of rheumatology with curative treatment approaches for patients affected by systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases.

In cognitive neuropsychological studies of adults and children with brain damage or learning disabilities, we are using behavioral and functional neuroimaging methods to examine deficits in the early perceptual stages of reading (e.g., Schubert & McCloskey, 2014; Schubert, Reilhac, & McCloskey, 2018), and in the writing processes that translate knowledge of a word’s spelling into the movements necessary to write the word (e.g., McCloskey, Reilhac, & Schubert, 2018). Our aims are to gain insight into normal mental representations and processes and how these are instantiated in the brain, as well as to advance our understanding of cognitive deficits and how they may be treated. We are also exploring the representations and processes underlying reading and writing through behavioral studies of neurotypical participants (e.g., Wong, Wadee, Ellenblum, & McCloskey, 2018), and computational modeling. 

In the domain of visual perception, we are probing representations of object orientation and shape acquired through vision and touch. Here we exploit errors in recalling the orientations of objects to make inferences about the structure of shape and orientation representations (e.g., McCloskey, 2009; Gregory & McCloskey, 2010; Hatfield, McCloskey, & Park, 2016; Chaisilprungraung, German, & McCloskey, 2019).  These studies use behavioral and functional neuroimaging methods, with participants including neurotypical adults and children, individuals with perceptual deficits, and congenitally blind adults.

Finally, I am interested in foundational issues in cognitive science, including the rationale for adopting a representational/computational conception of the mind, the relationship between cognitive science and neuroscience, the rationale for using deficits as a basis for conclusions about normal cognition (e.g., McCloskey & Chaisilprungraung, 2017), and the role of simulation in cognitive science (e.g., McCloskey, 1991).",Krieger 143A | 143 (lab),Krieger Hall,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/mccloskey-lab/
Michael Osmanski,Research Associate,Biomedical Engineering,"hearing, auditory behavior, complex sound processing, vocal perception, primates, vocal communication, psychoacoustics, psychophysics","We use a nonhuman primate model system to understand how the auditory system processes and represents sounds. We currently work along three parallel lines of inquiry:

1. Examining the sensitivity and acuity of the marmoset monkey auditory system using psychophysical and operant conditioning techniques. Our lab published the first behavioral audiogram for the marmoset using a tone detection paradigm and showed that these animals hear across a frequency range similar to other New World primate species, with a sensitivity peak around  the typical frequency of many of their common vocalizations. Using a similar discrimination task, we have also measured frequency difference limens (FDLs) in the marmoset. FDLs, which measure the minimum detectable change for a given frequency and are inversely related to pitch strength, were tested across the marmoset’s full hearing range. Results suggest that the lowest relative FDL overlaps with the most sensitive region of the marmoset audiogram as well as with the fundamental frequency range of their typical vocalizations. This work has provided the first data describing the limits on hearing acuity for this species, which is critical for future studies exploring behavioral discrimination and neurophysiological processing of complex sounds, including vocalizations.

2. Describing the ways in which pitch, one of the oldest studied percepts in the auditory system, is processed by marmosets. Pitch can be computed using either frequency (spectral) or timing (temporal envelope) cues. We test marmosets in behavioral experiments in which we manipulate complex harmonic tones in ways that allow us to disentangle the relative use of these two cues in pitch extraction. Neurophysiological work using single-unit electrophysiology shows that neurons in a specialized pitch region in a low-frequency area of primary auditory cortex also extract pitch using these cues. A recent study from our lab showed that marmosets exhibit all the primary features of central pitch mechanisms that have been demonstrated in humans (including the dominance of resolved harmonics on pitch strength and a sensitivity to the quality of spectral harmonicity), which suggests that these mechanisms possibly emerged early in primate evolution. 

3.  Characterizing how species-specific vocalizations are perceived by marmosets. We recently completed a detailed, quantitative analysis of a large number of vocalizations produced by marmosets recorded over several years, which has served as the basis for studying the perceptual significance of different features of marmoset vocalizations in a series of recent experiments. These experiments have shown that marmosets a) perceptually group their vocalizations into natural categories, b) perceive different features of their vocalizations in ways that appear to depend on the population statistics of those vocalizations and that maximize the discrimination of different call-types, and c) have perceptual specializations for processing species-specific vocalizations that are different than processing simpler, non-vocal stimuli and that are consistent with similar kinds of effects reported in human speech.",Traylor 410,Traylor,http://wanglab.johnshopkins.edu/lab/WangLabWebsite/index.html

Miho Iijima,Professor ,Cell Biology,Lipid signaling chemotaxis,"Mechanisms of gradient sensing and chemotaxis are conserved in mammalian leukocytes and Dictyostelium amoebae. Both cells use G protein linked signaling pathways. PH domains specific for PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 bind to the membrane at the leading edge of the chemotaxing cell. This suggests that the local production of these phosphoinositides are regulated by PI3Ks and PTEN phosphatases and are a key component of directional sensing. The translocation of specific PH domain containing proteins at the leading edge likely regulates actin polymerization and pseudopud formation. Phosphoinositide secondary messengers may include members of the small GTPase Rho family, which have dramatic effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. These GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The GEFs for Rho/Rac/cdc42 each contain a PH domain and a catalytic Dbl homology domain, some of which have been shown to bind to the PIP3.

In order to make a further connection between signaling events and directional movement, we have identified 17 new PH domain-containing proteins in addition to 10 previously known genes in the Dictyostelium cDNA and genome database. Five of these genes contain both the Dbl and the PH domains, suggesting these proteins are involved in actin polymerization. A PTEN homologue has been also identified in Dictyostelium that is highly conserved with the human gene. We are disrupting all of these genes and studying their roles in chemotaxis.",119A Hunterian,Hunterian,http://www.iijima-sesaki-lab.com/

We have made seminal discoveries involving Toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-1β/inflammasome responses and the role of different T cell subsets (especially IL-17-producing T cells). In particular, we are currently investigating protective immunity to Staphylococcus aureus, which is the most common human bacterial skin pathogen. This area of research is highly significant, since S. aureus infections represent a major public health threat due to the widespread emergence of virulent community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Our long-term goal is to discover mechanisms that can serve as targets for future immune-based therapies and vaccination strategies. In our work involving pathogenic immune mechanisms and dysbiosis of the skin microbiome in contributing to skin inflammation, we have made key discoveries involving the role of IL-36, MyD88-signaling and STAT3-signaling.

Our research has used innovative in vivo preclinical models, including pioneering advanced techniques of in vivo whole animal optical (bioluminescence and fluorescence) imaging to track bacterial clearance and host immune responses noninvasively and longitudinally over time, human skin organotypic culture models and novel humanized mouse models possessing both human skin and immune cells. Our laboratory has been funded with NIH grant support (R01’s and K01 grants) and extensive industry and foundation support.

In addition to our work in the skin, we are investigating protective immune responses and novel antibacterial coatings to help treat or prevent bacterial biofilm-related infections of medical devices, prostheses and implants. These infections are a devastating complication as bacterial biofilms form on the foreign implanted materials, which inhibit the efficacy of antibiotics and blocks penetration of immune cells. We have multiple preclinical animal models of these post-surgical infections using the latest technology in multimodality imaging, including optical, PET, CT and photoacoustic imaging. The goal is to provide new insights into protective immune responses and novel treatments against these biofilm-related implant infections.",CRBII 2M04,Koch Cancer Research Building,https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dermatology/research/basic_science/archer_lab/

Based on the material evidence of the frescoes themselves, their stylistic, iconographic, and socio-political context, I demonstrate the impact of the principles of the Reform Movement for the revival of Early Christian ideals and imagery and for the specific reception of antiquity in twelfth-century Rome. The juxtaposition of an anthropomorphic representation of the Old Testament god with an image theoretical inscription at Ceri initiated one of the primary intellectual curiosities that drive my research: the impact of medieval image theory on the representation of the “invisible God”. Thus, in several articles and a co-edited volume (Die Sichtbarkeit des Unsichtbaren: Zur Korrelation von Text und Bild im Wirkungskreis der Bibel, with Bernd Janowski (Stuttgart, 2003), I investigate medieval concepts of representation and vision both in relationship to the frescoes in Ceri and more broadly.

My most recent book Art, Ritual, and Civic Identity in Medieval Southern Italy (Pennstate University Press 2014) investigates the creation, function, and change of the significance of stunningly beautiful and complex liturgical furnishings and richly illuminated manuscripts in southern Italy (including Sicily). This book spans a wide time period, setting the stage with an analysis of the Late Antique development of liturgical practices and furniture in the West as well as in the Eastern Mediterranean including Syria and Asia Minor, and ends in the fourteenth century. My approach concerns primarily the conceptual dimensions of these artworks, investigating the different modes of interaction that occur between church furnishings, images, and ritual movement. I engage with the recent methodological discourses in art history, most importantly with regard to the performative aspects of works of art and their reception, but also about issues of movement, narrativity, and processes of decoding.

I am currently working on two projects. One is a book-length study True images? The question of authenticity in medieval art that investigates concepts of authenticity and processes of authentication in medieval art. Here, I go beyond regional borders to address questions that developed from my interest in medieval attitudes toward images of cult and devotion: Which strategies—visual and other—were developed for creating images of the Christian god and the saints that would be acceptable for veneration? Can we discern a general theoretical discourse about truth that finds its visual expression in the production of medieval works of art? What establishes the authenticity of an image that is designed for cult and devotion, and how does knowledge about an image’s maker relate to its perception as authentic? I address the question of authenticity across a variety of examples, reaching beyond the cult image to include seals, legal documents, woodcuts, portraits, pilgrim badges, Agnus dei capsules etc. The broader aim of this book is to explore the conceptual character of medieval art and its paradoxical nature through the application of more recent view points from the fields of anthropology, social history, religion, media- and visual studies. 

A second research project begins to take shape that concerns the medium of the illuminated scroll in the Middle Ages. I envision to explore scrolls in a global context and in a collaborative process that could result in an exhibition of  Late Antique papyri, Torah scrolls, Japanese and Chinese hand scrolls, Byzantine Biblical scrolls, Western medieval liturgical scrolls, and chronicles and hence will reach out to Jewish, Islamic, Asian, and Ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures.

In addition to my research on medieval art and motivated by the German academic tradition that requires a secondary competence, I have published on the intersection between natural philosophy and science and the fine arts in 19th-century Germany and Denmark. In particular, I have focused on the role of the natural philosopher H.C. Ørsted for the education and formation of the artists at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. A co-edited volume Fictions of Isolation: Artistic and Intellectual Exchange in Rome during the First Half of the Nineteenth Century, with Lorenz Enderlein (Rome, 2006), investigates the intellectual background of the artistic and theoretical discourses in Rome in the first half of the 19th century is part of this broader interest in 19th-century art. I find that embarking on an entirely new and different field has proved immensely beneficial for my intellectual journey as a medievalist and art historian.",Gilman 180,Gilman Hall,

Patricia Janak,Bloomberg Distinguished Professor,"Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,Neuroscience","Systems, Cognitive, Computational Neuroscience; Neural Circuits, Ensembles, Connectomes; Neurobiology of Disease","We are interested in the behavioral and neural mechanisms of associative learning - the simple learning of relations between environmental stimuli and the outcomes they predict (Pavlovian processes) and between motor actions and the outcomes they produce (instrumental processes). These simple learned associations guide our behavioral responses to environmental stimuli that continually surround us. Associative learning also provides a means whereby stimuli in the environment come to regulate our emotional responses and to strongly bias our decision-making. Thus, we seek to define the behavioral and neural mechanisms for the acquisition of reward-based associations. We are particularly interested in the neural systems that control expression of stimulus-guided behavior after learning. Because associative learning mechanisms contribute to pathological behaviors, such as drug and alcohol addiction and overeating, an additional aspect of our work is translational. In these studies, we apply our findings on associative learning to better understand how drug- and alcohol-associated stimuli contribute to relapse. To realize our basic and translational goals, we use well-defined animal models of learning and addiction in concert with in vivo electrophysiological measurement and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal populations in specific brain regions and circuits.",Dunning Hall 246,Wyman Quad,http://www.janaklab.com/

Fusing philosophical perspectives on Judaism with thorough archival research, my work lies at the intersection of philological examination and close readings of primary sources and the discussion of the social background of intellectual phenomena. My most recent research focuses on the history and phenomenology of Jewish heterodoxy and heresy in 18th- and 19th-century Eastern and Central Europe.

In 2011, I published a monograph titled The Mixed Multitude: Jacob Frank and the Frankist Movement 1755-1816 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press). The book analyzes the formation of Frankism, a heterodox Jewish movement that originated in Poland and spread into the Habsburg Empire and the German lands in the second half of the 18th century. Whereas earlier movements of a similar nature had little impact on surrounding societies, Frankism raised significant religious and political waves in contemporary non-Jewish communities and became a real cause célèbre of its time: it captured the interest of Joseph II and Catherine the Great, Goethe and Casanova, among others. Jacob Frank, the movement’s leader, actively formulated his teachings as challenges to other religions: normative Judaism, Islam, and various denominations of Christianity. The study of Frankism thus presents an opportunity for a nuanced discussion of the internal diversity of modern Jewry and – at the same time – for a cross-sectional view of Jewish-Gentile relations during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Mixed Multitude was awarded the Polonsky Prize for Creativity and Originality in Humanistic Disciplines by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the two most important awards in Jewish Studies granted by scholarly bodies in the US, the Salo Baron Prize by the American Academy of Jewish Research, and Jordan Schnitzer Book Award by the Association of Jewish Studies. It has been or is currently being translated into Hebrew, Polish, Russian, Italian, and French.

Current projects -

- The blood-brain barrier (BBB).    The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system and protects the central nervous system from potentially harmful chemicals while regulating transport of essential nutrients. We are using tissue engineering, stem cell technology, and microfabrication to reverse engineer the blood-brain barrier. Reverse engineering is the process of understanding the function of individual components in anything man-made (usually through disassembly), to enable reproduction. This reductive approach to understanding the role of individual components is particularly well suited for the BBB, which is inherently complex and involves multiple cell types. In particular it allows us to elucidate the underlying physical and biochemical processes that regulate the phenotype of brain capillaries and microvessels, while simultaneously allowing us to systematically increase the complexity of the model.

- In vitro models of the tumor microenvironment. Metastasis, which is responsible for more than 90% of cancer-related deaths, involves a sequence of steps including invasion, dormancy, intravasation, arrest, extravasation, and colonization at a secondary site. These are dynamical processes that occur at or near the vascular system and are very difficult to visualize in vivo. Our incomplete understanding of the steps in the metastatic cascade is a major barrier to developing therapies to prevent the spread of the disease and improve patient outcomes. Recent advances in the development of in vitro microvessel models provide the tools to create more physiological models of the tumor microenvironment and to visualize steps in the metastatic cascade. We are developing tissue-engineered models of the tumor microenvironment to visualize steps in the metastatic cascade. These models include tumor vasculature, post-capillary venules, and capillary networks. These models are also being used for testing and imaging drug and gene delivery vehicles.

-Modeling diverse diseases.   Vascular influences on diseases of every organ system are increasingly key to understanding the progression of disease and developing therapeutics that target key dysfunction.  However, many sensitive tissue sites prevent in vivo advanced study of the vasculature and its effect on surrounding parenchyma.    Utilizing our in vitro microvascular platform, we are able to recapitulate key geometric, chemical, and biological contributors to disease and study its impact on the vasculature withhigh spatiotemporal resolution.  Currently, we are developing and studying models of infectious disease and neurodegenerative disease to assess the activity of  vascular barrier loss, blood-tissue exchange, and other functional changes in response to the disease state.",Croft Hall 120,Croft ,https://pages.jh.edu/searson/

The laboratory is also actively investigating adjunctive host-directed therapies, in order to shorten the duration of TB treatment and improve lung function outcomes. Finally, molecular assays using blood, sputum, and urine samples are being investigated with the goal of developing rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care tests for TB diagnosis and detection of drug resistance.","Major research activities include studying the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to stress conditions believed to be important in the infected human host, as well as the phenomenon of phenotypic tolerance to antibiotics. In particular, the regulatory cascade involved in the mycobacterial stringent response is under active investigation. A systems biology-based approach is being used to identify host defense mechanisms responsible for immunological control of M. tuberculosis growth, as well as M. tuberculosis regulatory and metabolic pathways required for bacterial persistence and antibiotic tolerance.

Malaria, caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, is transmitted to humans by infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The evolution of drug resistance by the parasite, and insecticide resistance by the mosquito, have created an urgent need for new strategies to control and ultimately eradicate this scourge.

Our research focuses on the infective stage of the malaria parasite, sporozoites, which are inoculated into the skin by infected mosquitoes. Sporozoites make an impressive journey from the midgut wall of the mosquito where they emerge from oocysts, to their final destination, the mammalian liver (see picture below). Using biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches as well as intravital imaging and proteomics, we aim to understand the molecular interactions between sporozoites and their mosquito and mammalian hosts that enable the parasite to initiate infection. Recently we have started investigating the quantitative dynamics of sporozoite transmission, an understudied yet important area of inquiry if we are to improve our epidemiologic models and define the minimum efficacy required of transmission blocking interventions.","615 N.

Clinical disease is caused by the exponentially growing parasites within the red blood cells (RBCs). We study the dynamic processes regulating successful parasite entry into and exit from host cells. Our goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating important biological processes outlined below. To address these questions we use complementary approaches encompassing conditional genome editing techniques, live cell imaging, high throughput screening, biochemistry and proteomics.

1. Understanding receptor-ligand interactions and the signaling mechanisms mediating parasite invasion: Successful parasite entry into host cells requires a sequence of receptor-ligand interactions, each responsible for a specific step in invasion. We study the signaling mechanisms that regulate the precise spatial and temporal secretion of parasite ligands and how these interactions shape the fate of the invading parasite.

2. Parasite induced modifications of the host cell: We are investigating the molecular interactions between the parasite and the host cell cytoskeleton that facilitates parasite entry without causing damage to the host cell.

3. Malaria vaccine development: We apply our understanding of how proteins function during parasite invasion to identify new vaccine targets and improve the design of existing antigens.

By studying the key factors and mechanisms by which they regulate host cell egress and invasion, we seek to open new paths for the development of novel intervention strategies to block invasion and prevent disease.","615 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21205",615 N. Wolfe Street,

Infectious diseases epitomize a complex disease because both genetic and environmental factors must play a role in susceptibility and progression of disease. The exposure to an environmental pathogen is critical to risk, but genes in the host can influence innate and adaptive immunity and thus the risk of disease and its severity. My goal is to identify the underlying mechanisms of infectious disease by identifying host genetic variants that alter or influence our immune response.
I work with adult and pediatric populations within the United States and Internationally (Bangladesh, Brazil) to identify host genes associated with parasitic (E. histolytica, Cryptosporidium, Giardia) and viral (hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, rotavirus) infections.

His lab uses the filament model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to investigate physiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie stroke. It is already known that the formation of reactive oxygen species after stroke damages DNA, which leads to the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) and formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers. In partnership with researchers in the Institute of Cell Engineering at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Koehler and his colleagues are investigating how release of these polymers from the nucleus triggers the release of apoptosis-inducing factors from the mitochondria and causes neuronal cell death.

Related areas of investigation include ischemic preconditioning, ways to improve tissue oxygenation, mechanisms of abnormal cerebrovascular reactivity after ischemia.

In addition to ischemic stroke, Dr. Koehler is studying mechanisms of term neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in a newborn model of asphyxia. His lab is tailoring therapies to selectively vulnerable striatum, where neurons die rapidly and hypothermia loses its efficacy when induction is delayed. The lab is evaluating drugs that can be administered soon after resuscitation from asphyxia for their potential to extend the therapeutic window of hypothermia.

The project title is “Using satellite surface salinity measurements to derive and predict changes in dense water properties in the Labrador Sea.”

Overview: This project will demonstrate the value of satellite salinity measurements by using them to derive and predict changes in dense water mass properties in the Labrador Sea, which is one of the key variables in the Earth’s climate system and global ocean circulation. The occurrence and intensity of deep convection in the Labrador Sea is determined by the strength of the ocean stratification and wintertime atmospheric conditions. The upper Labrador Sea is stratified by salinity in winter and the buoyancy erosion happens almost exclusively through surface heat fluxes. Thus, local surface salinity is a prime indicator for the likelihood of convection. Furthermore, salinity properties in the two upper—buoyant—layers of the Labrador Sea is advected in from the surface Arctic Ocean and surface subtropical North Atlantic Basin, respectively. Thus, it is largely predictable ahead of time. The objectives of the project are to demonstrate to what extent (1) satellite surface salinity measurements in the Labrador Sea can be used to derive changes in dense water mass properties, and (2) satellite surface salinity measurements over the Arctic and Subtropical North Atlantic can be used to predict changes in dense water mass properties in the Labrador Sea.",328 Olin Hall,Olin,

Richard Huganir,Bloomberg Distinguished Professor ,"Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,Biological Chemistry,Neuroscience,Brain Science Institute","Developmental Neuroscience; Cellular, Molecular Neuroscience","REGULATION OF NEUROTRANSMITTER RECEPTORS AND BRAIN FUNCTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE  Neurotransmitter receptors mediate signal transduction at the postsynaptic membrane of synaptic connections between neurons in the nervous system. We have been studying the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor function. Recently we have focused on glutamate receptors, the major excitatory receptors in the brain. Glutamate receptors can be divided into two major classes: AMPA and NMDA receptors. AMPA receptors mediate rapid excitatory synaptic transmission while NMDA receptors play important roles in neuronal plasticity and development. Studies in our laboratory have found that both AMPA and NMDA receptors are multiply phosphorylated by a variety of protein kinases. Phosphorylation regulates several functional properties of these receptors including conductance and membrane targeting. Recent studies in our lab have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of AMPA receptors is regulated during cellular models of learning and memory such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Moreover, phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit is required for the expression of these forms of plasticity and for the retention of spatial memory and also regulates emotional memory formation and erasure.  We have also been examining the mechanisms of the subcellular targeting and clustering of glutamate receptors at synapses. We have recently identified a variety of proteins that directly or indirectly interact with AMPA and NMDA receptors. We have found a novel family of proteins that we call GRIPs (Glutamate Receptor Interacting Proteins) that directly bind to the C-termini of the GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors. GRIPs contain seven PDZ domains, protein-protein interaction motifs, which crosslink AMPA receptors to each other or link them to other proteins. In addition, we have found that the C-termini of GluR2 also interacts with the PDZ domain of PICK1, a protein kinase C-binding protein that is found at excitatory synapses. The GluR2 subunit also interacts with the NSF protein, a protein involved in the regulation of membrane fusion events. These AMPA receptor interacting proteins are critical in the proper membrane trafficking and synaptic targeting of these receptors. We have shown that the binding of PICK1 and GRIP is required for a specific form of LTD in the cerebellum that is a cellular model for motor learning. Moreover, we have found that this receptor complex is critical for hippocampal LTP and LTD and spatial learning.  In addition to these studies on AMPA receptors, we have been characterizing a separate NMDA receptor associated protein complex that is important in synaptic targeting and downstream signaling of NMDA receptors. We have identified an excitatory synapse specific rasGAP, which we call synGAP that regulates synaptic Ras signaling and has profound effects on synaptic plasticity.  Importantly, recent evidence has implicated glutamate receptor associated complexes in several neurological and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, mental retardation as well as in chronic pain and drug addiction.  In summary, we have examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor function. Our studies have suggested that regulation of receptor function may be a major mechanism for the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the nervous system in health and disease and may be an important determinant of animal behavior.",Hunterian 1009A,Hunterian,http://neuroscience.bs.jhmi.edu/huganir/

Richard Markham,Professor,Molecular Microbiology and Immunology,HIV; pathogenesis; evolution; SCID; mouse; microbicide; vaccine,"1. A major recent effort of the laboratory has focused on the development of a novel vaccine platform that has demonstrated an ability to elicit profoundly elevated and sustained humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The initial target for this platform has been malaria. This target was chosen for three reasons: 1. This disease represents one of the major public health problems confronting the world today. 2. The infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Malaria Research Institute provides the tools necessary to carry this vaccine forward in mouse model systems, particularly an insectary and the availability of transgenic malaria strains enabling the testing of vaccine efficacy against human malaria targets in mice 3. The failure of the heavily funded, large scale clinical trial of the RTS,S malaria vaccine. This failure is, in my view, primarily attributable to the inability of this vaccine to elicit a sustained humoral immune response. 4. The ability to carry out direct challenge with drug sensitive malaria strains as part of Phase 1 clinical trials of the vaccine.

Our candidate vaccine fuses the vaccine antigen to a chemokine that targets the antigen to the immature dendritic cells that initiate the immune response. This vaccine construct elicits markedly elevated antibody concentrations that have been sustained at protective levels for 6 months in the mouse challenge systems, a time course previously unreported in this system. This finding of extended protection is of particular interest not simply because of its clinical relevance, but because it provides an opportunity to explore one of the critical questions of immunology and vaccine science in particular--the basis for extended immunological memory.

2. Use of a candidate vaccine platform for cancer immunotherapy.  Because of the marked efficacy of the vaccine platform in preventing malaria in mouse model systems, we are also evaluating its use as a therapeutic modality in mouse melanoma models.  Introducing some variations on the malaria vaccine approach, we have been able to extend survival 50% in treated mice.  We are expanding these studies for use in other cancer model systems and to apply this vaccine to novel approaches to cancer immunotherapy.

3. Use of toxin-fused camelid-derived single domain antibodies to treat viral infections. While the use of toxin-fused antibodies as a cancer therapeutic approach and has been considered for treating HIV, the use of camelid-derived single domain antibodies for this purpose has not been explored. The smaller size of single domain antibodies may enable engagement of proteins that would not be accessible to traditional antibodies. We have published data on the in vitro efficacy of this approach for HSV-2 and, in unpublished work, have developed a cross-clade reactive single domain antibody which is highly active and highly specific in eliminating HIV infected cells in in vitro systems.  Application of this approach to in vivo model systems will be undertaken in the near future.",Room E5150,Krieger Hall,

Rina Agarwala,Associate Professor,"Department of Sociology,Racism, Immigration, and Citizenship Program","International development, gender, labor, migration, globalization, India","I am fascinated by hierarchies of power—particularly how vulnerable populations sitting at the bottom of those hierarchies fight to advance their needs, and the conditions under which they succeed or fail to alter those very hierarchies.  My research has examined a range of populations (including informal workers and migrant workers), workers’ identities (including class, gender, caste, and migrant status), and worker industries (including construction; tobacco, garments, and automobile manufacturing; trash collection and recycling; and domestic work). My first book, Informal Labor, Formal Politics and Dignifying Discontent in India (Cambridge University Press, 2013), examined alternative labor movements among informal women workers and their relationship to the state in India.  My recent book, The Migration-Development Regime: How Class Shapes Indian Emigration (Oxford University Press, 2022),  examines how the Indian state has differentially used poor versus professional emigrant workers to shape India’s domestic development since the 1800s, and how Indian emigrants have differentially responded. My current project, called “The Social Insecurity Project,” examines how different populations (across genders, classes, and races/castes) differentially define and address the concept of social and economic “insecurity” as a value and need in and of itself and as distinct from income.

My empirical research relies on in-depth fieldwork, interviews, surveys, and ethnography.  While my empirical research has focused on India, my work has employed a cross-national comparative lens to further our understanding of the global economy. My work on Indian diaspora organizations in the U.S. collaborated with colleagues examining diaspora groups from 7 other countries in multiple receiving states. My work on informal workers’ movements collaborated with colleagues examining parallel movements in 7 other countries in the global South and North. My work on labor’s use of legal empowerment in India and my work on informal work in India’s 21st century social contracts were each part of collaborative projects comparing country experiences through the United Nations. My co-edited volume, Whatever Happened to Class? Reflections from South Asia (Routledge Press, 2008), explores how class-based analysis can help us better understand the contemporary challenges faced by urban workers, agricultural workers, and middle classes in India and Pakistan. My co-edited volume, Gendering Struggles against Informal and Precarious Work (PPST, 2018), explores the role that gender plays in shaping informal workers’ movements in India, Mexico, South Korea, Canada, and the U.S. My current project on social and economic insecurity will conduct field research in India, the U.S. and Denmark.  Although my research focusses on the contemporary period, I employ a comparative-historical lens. My work on informal workers’ movements traces the global rise of informal employment, and their corresponding social movements, since productions structures began to liberalize in the 1980s.  My work on global migrant workers traces cross-class emigration patterns from the 1800s to the present.",Mergenthaler 527,Keyser Quad,

Thus they also represent a promising targets for chemopreventive intervention. 

Finally, my laboratory is exploring the ability of combining polyamine depletion with epigenetically-targeted drugs to enhance antitumor immune response, and have demonstrated that the combination of ODC inhibition with a drug that reduces DNA methylation leads to a significant enhancement of the anti-tumor immune response in normally immunologically cold tumors.

Obesity, an increasingly common health problem in the U.S. and throughout the developed world, has been acknowledged as the second leading cause of death, behind smoking. Obesity has been linked to diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and a myriad of other health problems. Obesity results from disturbed energy balance, where energy intake (i.e. feeding) chronically exceeds total energy expenditure. A flurry of research activities has identified many genetic or biochemical components for nutrient sensing and has elucidated their roles in obesity and obesity-associated diseases. However the mechanism(s) underlying the development of obesity and the interplay between numerous components are still poorly understood. One of the primary goals in my laboratory is to understand how our body senses and responds to different levels of nutrients such as glucose or lipid, and how different pathways cross talk to each other. Moreover, we are also interested in how the disruption of nutrient sensing and utilization contributes to the development of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, heart failure or cognitive decline.

As human activity increasingly causes dramatic changes to our natural environment, we need to identify the rules governing the response of microbes to environmental changes for prediction and remediation purposes. The goal of our research is to identify the rules governing physical, chemical and biological interactions that influence microbial processes, which can be integrated into a computational framework to predict the microbial response to climate change or remediation efforts. This includes basic research questions, development of novel research tools, and the evaluation of existing biogeochemical models to explain the distribution and dynamics of microbial communities observed in space and time through sequence-based metagenomic analysis. Regardless of the specific approach, these efforts are designed to understand how physical, chemical and biological interactions influence microbial processes that affect the Earth’s ecosystem.

While traditional microbiology focuses on understanding microorganisms as they function in pure culture, environmental microbiology focuses on the complex interactions they experience in most natural settings and the challenges of studying them within environmental systems. To achieve achieve our goal, we often observe microorganisms in various aquatic ecosystems using their genetic information as a proxy for their presence and distribution. We commonly use high-throughput sequencing techniques to capture as much genetic signal from the microbial community as possible, coupled with bioinformatics and computational modeling to understand why microbial populations are present where and when they are.

Because these processes are ultimately mechanical in nature, our focus is developing and applying new laser-based optical instrumentation with high-resolution microscopy imaging to understand cellular mechanics.

What tools do we use? In addition to mature biochemical and cell biological techniques, we’ve developed and invented a number of advanced laser-based optical techniques to study live-cell processes. One example is analytical. Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, we’ve developed new quantitative paradigms that push its limits of resolution, allowing the depletion forces of polymerizing actin cytoskeleton to be observed for the first time. A second example is new instrumentation and analysis. Using ultra-high resolution laser-tracking (‘nano-tracking’), we invented a new way (“microrheology”) to measure cell mechanics during physiological processes. For example, the shapes of cells during cell division (cytokinesis) are linearly related to mechanical moduli of cellular cortex across many cytoskeletal mutants. Other instrumentation that we develop are optical tweezers (photonic forces), atomic force microscopy, and total-internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy.

What’s an example of our discoveries? The intracellular bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, causes food-born disease. Like other more severe pathogens (Rocky Mountain spotted fever bacteria and smallpox virus), Listeria ‘hijack’ host cell proteins to generate actin rocket tails that push bacteria into adjacent cells, thus spreading infection. These host cell proteins are the same proteins used during cell motility and phagocytosis, hence providing insight into normal cellular function. Using high-resolution ‘nano-tracking’, we discovered that Listeria moves with step-like motions and the steps are the size of the actin monomers used to construct tails. Steps are completely unexpected and shatter prior models of actin-based motility (see http://pages.jh.edu/~cmml/ for animations of models).",Wood Basic Science G10,Wood Basic Science Building,http://pages.jh.edu/~cmml/

The effects of greenhouses gases and air pollutants on climate and health are well-known. However, the emissions of these gases are often highly uncertain. We use observations of greenhouse gases collected from airplanes, towers, and satellites to estimate emissions across individual states to entire continents. Furthermore, we want to understand more than just how much is being emitted but also where these gases are emitted, why they are emitted, and who or what is responsible. Our recent projects investigate methane emissions from the US oil and gas industries, natural greenhouse gas sources from the Arctic (as in the photo above), and the effectiveness of recent greenhouse gas regulations in China.

Our research incorporates several broad themes:

1. Energy systems: Coal, oil, and natural gas industry operations sometimes leak gases into the atmosphere, particularly methane. In many cases, these leaks could be fixed, or the gases could be captured and used to produce energy. We want to understand the magnitude of these emissions, how they compare to other human-caused sources, and the effectiveness of recent emissions regulations.

2. Natural sources: Natural greenhouse gas sources and sinks will likely change as the Earth’s climate warms. In order to robustly predict these future changes, we need to understand what levers control current natural sources and sinks. We use a wide variety of atmospheric and satellite observations to understand the environmental factors that drive these sources and sinks with a goal of improving future predictions.  

3. Big data: Satellite technology for monitoring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has improved dramatically in the past decade.

To identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell specification in the CNS, we use the mouse retina and hypothalamus, both of which arise from the ventral embryonic forebrain.  The relatively simple anatomy of the retina provides an excellent system to identify molecular mechanisms that regulate neuronal cell fate.  The hypothalamus, which is a central regulator of behaviors ranging from sleep to feeding to reproduction, offers an opportunity to bring the power of developmental genetics to help unravel the neural circuitry controlling a huge range of experimentally tractable and medically important behaviors.  In recent years, we have worked to map out the transcriptional regulatory networks controlling the developmental competence of retinal progenitor cells, photoreceptor specification and survival, as well how retinal glia are specified and help promote photoreceptor survival.  In the hypothalamus, we have identified transcription factors that are essential for specification of neural circuitry controlling circadian rhythms and sleep.  We also discovered that tanycytes of the hypothalamic median eminence are a diet-responsive neural progenitor cell population.  Future work will investigate the function of novel candidate regulators of retinal and hypothalamic cell identity, the role of previously uncharacterized hypothalamic cell subtypes in regulating motivated behaviors, and the contribution of tanycyte-derived neurogenesis to the regulation of feeding and body weight.

Specifically, they have been identifying the substrates of UBE3A that are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. UBE3A itself and at least one of these substrates is relevant to Alzheimer’s disease. They have since aimed part of our efforts to advancing an understanding of protein degradation mechanisms relevant to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiology. 

In the course of their studies, Dr. Margolis and his team made an unexpected discovery which was built logically on the laboratories long standing interests. In short, they discovered a novel neuronal specific membrane associated proteasome complex that through extracellular proteasome-derived peptides modulates neuronal signaling. This system is contributes to activity dependent neuronal signaling and is disrupted in disease. The robustness, uniqueness, and reproducibility have kept them moving forward in order to generate significant future advances in tools and information to comprehend the role of this signaling in the nervous system both in health and disease.  In the long term, Dr. Margolis envisions the lab following these pathways to address the following questions:

    What are the substrates of this proteasome complex and the sequences of the signaling peptides? 
    How do these NMP derived peptides mediate their signaling capacity and specificity?
    What is the full make up of the neuronal membrane proteasome (NMP) complex and how is it regulated?
    What is the importance of this pathway to neuronal physiology and animal behavior in health and disease?

They hope to leverage their findings in order to better define this emerging field and provide the tools and information important for their research and the field of cellular and molecular neuroscience as a whole.",WBSB 517,Wood Basic Science Building,http://www.margolislab.org

While Sjögren’s disease is commonly associated with dry eye and dry mouth, its impact on the peripheral and central nervous systems is significant.  I am especially intrigued by the neuroimmunological consequences of Sjögren’s disease. Some patients may exhibit severe ocular surface disease with diminished corneal sensation, leading to neurotrophic keratitis, while others may experience intense eye pain in the absence of significant ocular surface disease, termed neuropathic corneal pain.  Through my research, I aim to shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying these ocular surface diseases and their potential neurological implications.

Shigeki Watanabe,Associate Professor,"Cell Biology,Neuroscience",Microscopy; synaptic plasticity; Cell biology; Neuroscience,"My lab studies the cellular and molecular basis of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Neuronal signaling events at synapses determine circuit responses and result in specific behavioral outputs. This signaling is dynamic – modulated by synapse activity history and perceived stimuli. Three basic parameters control the synaptic output: 1) the probability of synaptic release, 2) the number of synaptic vesicles available for exocytosis, and 3) the number of postsynaptic receptors and their alignment to fusion sites. We aim to elucidate how these parameters are regulated at the ultrastructural level and how they are influenced by other cells such as astrocytes and microglia.

1. Spatial, temporal, and molecular control of synaptic release. The probability of synaptic release is controlled by many factors including the amount of ion flux (i.e. Ca2+, Na+, K+), Ca2+ buffering capacity, sensitivity of vesicles to Ca2+, distance of vesicles to Ca2+ source, and fusion-competence of vesicles. We developed a technique, zap-and-freeze, that couples electrical stimulation with high-pressure freezing to characterize vesicle fusion with millisecond temporal resolution. Using this approach along with protein localization methods, we are investigating spatial, temporal, and molecular control of vesicle fusion in different types of neurons in the mammalian central nervous system and how astrocytes contribute to these functions.

2. Cellular and molecular basis of vesicle regeneration and proteostasis. The recycling process regulates, in part, availability of synaptic vesicles and is tightly coupled to proteostasis. This process requires a series of membrane remodeling. Using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and advanced electron microscopy approaches, we are investigating cellular, molecular, and structural basis of membrane remodeling at synapses. Currently, we are focusing on four fundamental events at synapses: endocytosis, endosomal membrane budding (protein sorting mechanism for recycling and degradation), protein degradation (multivesicular body and autophagosome formation), and protein aggregate clearance by microglia. We are developing approaches to visualize the interactions of proteins in situ using cryo-electron tomography, with the ultimate goal to visualize these processes even in human brain tissues without fluorescently labelling proteins.

3. Neurotransmitter receptor trafficking. Neurotransmitter receptors diffuse into and out of the post-synaptic receptive field and are transiently anchored in “slots” within the field: occupancy of the slots by the receptors and alignment of the receptors to presynaptic fusion sites can modulate synaptic strength. To visualize receptors in electron micrographs, we have developed small-metal affinity staining of His-tag (SMASH) approach to label His-tagged proteins with nickel-coupled gold nanoparticles. Using a combination of approaches we have developed, we are currently investigating the endocytic mechanism that internalizes glutamate receptors at synapses. We will extend our study to other neurotransmitter receptors as well as neuropeptide receptors in the future.",100 Biophysics,Shaffer,http://cellbio.jhmi.edu/people/faculty/shigeki-watanabe-phd

Shreesh Mysore,Associate Professor,"Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences,Program in Neuroscience","Neural circuits for behavior (attention, decision-making), computational neuroscience, comparative approach to the design of neural circuits","Broadly speaking, we like to work on interesting neuroscientific questions that involve thinking about neural circuits, neural coding, and behavior in normal animals as well as animals with aberrant brain states. Although broad by design, this description serves as a unifying principle for everything that we do. At the moment, the lab focuses on stimulus selection for attention, and collaboratively, on the neural coding of affective states.
 
Selection is a singular and categorical event. One among numerous alternatives is chosen, while all the others are discarded (equivalently, each alternative can either be either chosen or not). Any neural hypothesis about selection must, therefore, involve competition among the representations of multiple alternatives, and must involve mechanisms that yield the categorical outcome of one alternative being chosen at the expense of all others. These mechanisms must operate in real time, changing with the changing stimuli in the environment. They must be amenable to plasticity, as the needs of an animal change over time. A big research thrust in the lab is to understand how the brain, at the level of neural circuits, accomplishes selection. Because selection is integral to many complex cognitive functions such as attention, decision making, and perception, the study of the neural mechanisms of selection in different contexts has fundamental implications to the understanding of circuit substrates of psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia, and has the potential to inform the development of therapeutic strategies.

A parallel research thrust in the lab is to investigate fundamental issues in the design of neural circuits. Considering the evolutionary richness in the animal world, investigating how different species implement neural solutions to aspects of behavior that are common across species and critical for survival, such as attention, reward learning, spatial navigation, etc is an extremely valuable endeavor. Such study has the potential to yield deep insights into basic brain function, and into the human condition. To complement current knowledge in the neural bases of these behaviors, the bulk of which comes from studies in mammals, we study these questions in birds.

Finally (and on a very different note), a metaphor that is commonly used for thinking about the brain is that it is a biological computer. However, there are fundamental differences between how a brain is designed and constructed, and how a computer is designed and put together, thereby limiting the extent to which this metaphor works. Importantly, brains can perform ""easily"" certain computational tasks that are considered to be hard for traditional computers. Could the differences in how brains and computers are built account for these differences in performance? If so, can we draw insights from studying brains and use them to build more efficient, versatile and powerful computing machines? We like to speculate/think about these questions at the interface of AI and BI, and look forward to the day when we will start investigating some of them.",Ames 224,Ames,https://mysorelab.johnshopkins.edu/

He has conducted pioneering research to advance the field of integrated computational structure-materials modeling into new areas of importance and challenges. Among his notable contributions are:

• The Voronoi Cell Finite Element Method (VCFEM): He has created the powerful Voronoi Cell Finite Element Method (VCFEM) for image-based computational micromechanical modeling of non-uniform heterogeneous microstructures like composites and porous materials. The method provides a link between microstructural characterization and mechanical response for microstructure-property relations. He has authored a comprehensive book on Micromechanical Analysis and Multi-Scale Modeling Using the Voronoi Cell Finite Element Method, published in 2011 based on this work. 
• Adaptive Multi-Scale Modeling of Heterogeneous Material: Professor Ghosh is one of the pioneers in adaptive multi-scale modeling invoking both hierarchical and concurrent models in a single framework for heterogeneous. Coupled with VCFEM, the spatial multi-scale methods have successfully predicted the evolution of brittle and ductile damage and failure across scales. Furthermore, his methods have coupled the multi-scale models with multi-scale image-characterization for multidisciplinary research on reliability and fatigue.
• 3D Material Characterization and Reconstruction: His work on reconstruction of 3D microstructures combining image analysis, statistical methods and microstructure builders, is recognized as one of the foremost in this area. This work has formed the foundation of the highly popular code DREAM.3D. 
• Multi-Time Scaling for Fatigue and Multi-Physics Problems: This successful activity in Prof. Ghosh’s group has received a lot of attention from various communities. A novel wavelet transformation based multi-time scaling (WATMUS) algorithm has been developed for accelerated cyclic crystal plasticity FE simulations and for multi-physics (electro-magnetic and mechanical) simulations with applications in sensors and antennae. The numerical simulations exhibit at least ~1000 times speed-up, over single time-scale solutions. This method is overcoming many bottlenecks for modeling fatigue and multi-physics problems.
• Deformation and Fatigue Modeling of Polycrystalline Materials: He has made significant advances in computational modeling of plasticity and cyclic deformation leading to fatigue and failure in polycrystalline Ti and Mg alloys, Ni-based superalloys and HSLA steels. His developments have spurred interest from the propulsion and automotive industries. 
• Parametrically Homogenized Constitutive-Damage Models (PHCMs): PHCMs of deformation and failure are thermodynamically consistent, reduced order continuum models with explicit representation of lower-scale (e.g. microstructural) descriptors and their distributions in parametric forms. These models are much more efficient and versatile than most other hierarchical multi-scale methods like the computational FE2 methods. This is a major development in multi-scale modeling and can encompass many scales in developing constitutive models. 
• Nanoscale Atomistic Modeling of Polymers and Metals: He has conducted significant research on the development of atomistic models of polymeric materials and metallic alloys for design of nano-scale devices and development of continuum models of deformation and failure. The models couple atomistic and continuum simulations to formulate crack evolution relations. 
• Spatio-Temporal Multi-Scale Modeling for Coupled Electromagnetics-Mechanical Simulations: In the recent years he has successfully developed a robust framework for coupling transient electromagnetic and dynamic mechanical fields for predicting the evolution of electrical and magnetic fields in vibrating substrates undergoing finite deformation.

Using interdisciplinary frameworks and multiple methodologies to examine these issues, my current research focuses on the sociology of education, urban sociology, neighborhoods and social inequality in the life course. My research also involves the sociological consideration of education and housing policy. I am motivated by an interest in rigorous research designs for causal inference using both experimental and non-experimental data, as well as the use of qualitative work to understand causality and the effectiveness of social policies. My research has been made possible by generous support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Abell Foundation, Spencer Foundation, National Academy of Education, William T. Grant Foundation, Center for Research on Educational Opportunity at the University of Notre Dame, American Educational Research Association, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education.

One major area of research has focused on the determinants of educational attainment, such as social class, high school courses, noncognitive skills and the timing of educational investments. In a project funded by the Department of Education, we examined the state of vocational education, in light of legislation passed in the 1990s intended to reform vocational training into “career and technical education”. In a recent Sociology of Education article, we move beyond traditional research on curricular tracking and show how a balance of academic and career preparation courses might reduce high school dropout. We suggest that the ‘new’ vocational education has potential to keep youth in school by engaging them with courses relevant for both work and college. In a recent Social Forces piece, we tested whether being a “day late” is worse than being “a dollar short” in terms of college enrollment. Even in an era of community college expansion, proprietary schools and evening programs, we found that it matters when you enroll in college; after accounting for socioeconomic, life course and institutional factors, youth who delay college significantly reduce their chances of attaining a bachelor’s degree, even within eight years. I have also been pursuing research that considers the role of noncognitive skills (e.g. motivation, self-discipline, risk taking), how patterns of noncognitive skills vary by levels of cognitive skills, and how different combinations of cognitive and noncognitive skills predict educational, occupational and delinquent pathways into adulthood.

An additional program of research examines transitions to work for young people who do not attend college, and more generally to question whether promoting college attendance for all is the best policy for students in America. A recent paper with Robert Bozick suggests heterogeneity in the motives of non-enrolled youth; these motives are partly driven by planful orientations toward work, economic resources and local labor market opportunities. Other papers in progress considers the transition to work and college for African American youth growing up in Baltimore. In a number of papers, I am considering the role of career education, trade schools and communities colleges in the employment and postsecondary pathways of these urban youth.",PIRL/Abel-Wolman,3213 North Charles St,https://otheramerica.org/faculty-and-staff/stefanie-deluca

After all these drug and exercise studies I then perform functional studies (Echos and ECGs) to see if certain drugs can mitigate the deleterious impact of exercise on ACM pathogenesis.

That said, the study of interplay between intervention and context must, itself, take place in a context. My principal contexts to date have been malaria and maternal health. My initial malaria research focused on determining the characteristics of a culturally appropriate insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) in the Peruvian Amazon. I’ve continued work on ITNs in Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda and am currently collaborating on two ITN projects with VectorWorks (http://www.vector-works.org/) at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (ccp.jhu.edu). Working with the World Health Organization, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, and the Zambia National Malaria Control Center, I helped develop training materials that enable community health workers to use malaria rapid diagnostic tests safely and effectively (https://www.finddx.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/generic_pf_training_manual.pdf). My interests also include malaria in pregnancy. In maternal health, my principal focus has been testing the clinical competency of skilled birth attendants (SBAs) and improving the cultural competency of labor and delivery care. Additional interests include Chagas disease, clean cook stoves to prevent household air pollution and associated illnesses, and food waste (dumpster diving and discarded food from grocery stores in the United States).
Methods

Though my research includes quantitative approaches, my focus is more qualitative. I am a particular proponent of observation since I find it is often more accurate than relying on reported behavior (interviews) and captures a level of detail that is not possible using other methods.","615 N.

Our research includes software for aligning and assembling genomes, gene and transcriptome analysis, and microbiome analysis. We work closely with biomedical scientists to apply our methods to current problems arising in a broad spectrum of biological and medical research areas. We’re part of the Center for Computational Biology, a group of 20+ faculty members and their labs at Hopkins working on computational, statistical, and mathematical methods that can turn massive genomic data sets into biologically and clinically useful information.

Research Project Areas. Our lab currently works in four related but distinct areas:

1. Computational gene finding and genome annotation. We have been working for many years on methods to identify genes, ranging from methods for bacterial gene finding to the development of a new human gene database, called CHESS. 

2. Transcriptome (RNA sequencing) analysis. Over the past decade, members of the lab along with our collaborators have developed multiple programs for RNA-seq analysis that have been adopted around the world. These include the Bowtie, TopHat, and Cufflinks programs, and more recently the HISAT and StringTie programs, with over 100,000 citations collectively. Together these programs align and assemble RNA sequencing data to reconstruct a detailed picture of all the genes and gene variants that are expressed in a tissue sample. The StringTie project is led by BME Prof. Ela Pertea, whose lab works closely with ours.

3. Genome Assembly. We develop genome assembly algorithms to use the latest generation of sequencing technologies, pushing the technology to take on ever-larger and more complex genomes, such as our current project to assemble the mega-genomes of the redwood and sequoia trees. We apply these methods in collaborations with biologists to sequence the genomes of species ranging from bacteria to plants and animals. See our Genome Projects page for a partial list of the many genomes we have assembled and published over the years.

4. Metagenomics and microbiome analysis.  We have developed a variety of tools to analyze metagenomics data sets, including the widely-used Kraken and Centrifuge systems. We have a special focus here on using metagenomic sequencing to diagnose infections in human patients.

Tamer el-Leithy,Assistant Professor,"Department of History,Program in Islamic Studies","Social & Cultural History of the Medieval Middle East and Mediterranean; History of Religious Difference; Arabic and Judeo-Arabic documents, the Cairo Geniza, and Arabic Documentary Cultures","I am principally interested in the history of religious difference in the medieval Middle East—how religious identity structured people’s lived experience and religious difference, but also how their social practices challenge and complicate the picture of inter-religious relations derived from traditional prescriptive sources (theological, legal, and polemical).

My forthcoming book, Coptic Muslims: Religious Difference and Conversion in Medieval Egypt examines the late-medieval mass conversion from Coptic Christianity to Islam—most likely the moment when Egypt became a ‘majority’ Muslim region. This pivotal process occurred almost seven centuries after the Arab-Muslim conquests; it was also one of the least ‘complete’ instances of Islamization in the region: Coptic Christians today comprise roughly 12% of Egypt’s population (the single largest non-Muslim community in the Arab-Muslim world). The conversion wave involved many converts who changed their personal religious identity—but more importantly, it also had deep and long-term effects on the religious traditions of Coptic Christianity and Islam.

I am currently working on two projects. The first, tentatively titled Arabization and the Deep Grammar of Religious Transformation, is a longue-durée cultural history of Egypt’s linguistic transformation form Coptic to Arabic (ca. 10th-13th c.). What impact did linguistic conversion have on the cultural valence of Arabic—and on religious difference, in general—in medieval Egypt? In addressing this question, I traces the various registers of Arabization and the different ways Coptic Christians—clerical and lay, urban and rural—negotiated this transformation and inhabited their new linguistic milieu. The study also explores the consequences of Arabization for the Coptic religious tradition (e.g. Biblical translations and a new Christian-Arabic theology) and for changes in religious and lay authority within the Coptic community. 

The second, smaller project—The Biography of a Alley in Late-Medieval Cairo: Coptic Family, Urban Property, and Legal Acculturation—is a micro-history that reconstructs a (predominantly) Coptic Christian neighborhood in 16th-century Cairo from a hitherto unknown cache of legal documents (and court records) to examine the relationship between family, property, and legal practice. Significantly, these Christian litigants conducted all their personal, familial, and communal affairs in Muslim courts (i.e. through Islamic law).",Gilman 330F,Gilman Hall,

On a molecular basis, we are interested in understanding the mechanism of action for existing antiparasitic agents, and in identifying vulnerable metabolic targets for much-needed, new, antiparasitic chemotherapy. Clinical studies are directed toward an evaluation, in humans, of the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and safety, of experimental antiparasitic drugs. The following are examples of ongoing work.

1. The topoisomerases, ""magicians of the cell"", catalyze alterations in the topological state of DNA. These reactions are essential for the orderly synthesis of nucleic acids and for cell survival. A number of clinically important antitumor and antibacterial drugs have as their mechanism of action the inhibition of topoisomerase activity. We have found that topoisomerase inhibitors, or gene silencing by means of RNA interference, cause dramatic alterations in the structure and replication of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in African trypanosomes (the organisms that cause sleeping sickness). We have also found that several of the classical antitrypanosomal drugs inhibit trypanosome topoisomerase activity in vivo. Of considerable importance, the severity of the molecular lesions attributable to enzyme inhibition correlates closely with trypanosome killing.

2. The advent and rapid spread of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria is widely regarded as a public health crisis. Safe new antimalarial drugs are urgently needed. Atovaquone, a broad-spectrum antiprotozoal agent, is almost unique in its dual action against both tissue and bloodstream stages of the malaria parasite. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which demonstrated that atovaquone can protect healthy volunteers against Plasmodium falciparum. The study used a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay to detect subclinical parasitemia and to distinguish between the two possible mechanisms for prophylaxis.","725 N.

Understanding low frequency natural climate perturbations is clearly a problem of special current relevance. Further, explaining natural climate variability is a prerequisite of addressing mankind’s effect on global climate.

Moreover, this understanding guides our thinking about other oceans in time and space. Recent discoveries of extra-terrestrial oceans in our solar system and recognition of how much Earth’s ocean has changed in the past, galvanizes me to think about the role of oceans in planetary system dynamics writ large.",301 & 327 Olin Hall,Olin ,https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/haine/

This aims for systematic assessment of the quality of all tools for regulatory toxicology and the development of new approaches based on annotated pathways of toxicity (the Human Toxome).

I have a broad background in clinical and experimental pharmacology and toxicology documented in more than 550 publications. Previous work centered on the immune recognition of bacteria, including pyrogen testing, and the induced inflammatory response. In experimental and clinical approaches, the pharmacological modulation of these responses was studied.

The current research takes a number of approaches. The first involves the identification of the neural representation of meal-related satiety signals. Multiple feedback signaling pathways are activated by food ingestion and the gastrointestinal presence of digestion products. We are examining how signals from multiple sites and stimulus modalities are integrated within specific brain nuclei and, in an effort to model eating disorders, how alterations in feeding patterns can influence these neural representations.

The second approach involves the identification of interactions between peripheral, within-meal, satiety signals and hypothalamic peptide systems involved in overall energy balance. We are currently examining how the activity of hypothalamic leptin, NPY, CCK, CFR, CART and melanocortin systems interact with ascending satiety pathways to alter meal size. We are also investigating how alteration in cellular energy availability and production are transduced into changes in food intake and body weight. These experiments focus on the de novo fatty acid synthesis pathway in critical hypothalamic sites and take advantage of a novel group of chemicals that inhibit the production of fatty acids and/or stimulate fatty acid oxidation. We are examining how exercise not only increases energy expenditure but also reduces food intake. These experiments focus on the regulation of peptide gene expression in hypothalamic systems involved in energy balance.

Finally, we are examining how gestational factors can bias metabolic programming to contribute to altered feeding and obesity.

Sound signals directly activate mechanically gated ion channels in hair cells, leading to hair cell depolarization and the release of neurotransmitters onto afferent neurons. Of all our senses, the mechanical senses are the least well understood. My laboratory uses genetic strategies to identify components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells. Using ENU mutagenesis, we have generated mouse lines that are afflicted with deafness. We have cloned the affected genes and studied their function for auditory perception. Using this strategy, we have identified several components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells. All of the identified genes are linked to auditory impairment in humans. Current efforts are aimed at the identification of additional components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells and at the mechanisms by which these proteins are regulated by mechanical force.

We chose fast eye movements (saccades) as the actions that needed to be controlled, because eye movements are relatively simple movements that are still under voluntary control. In the course of these experiments we detected signals that begin to explain how the consequences of actions are recognized and how subsequent actions might be influenced (Stuphorn et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2003; Schall et al., 2002).

A number of areas in the frontal cortex are involved in the control of fast eye movements in the countermanding task. We recorded in three of them: the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and found that the FEF on the one hand and the SEF and the ACC on the other hand seem to belong to two different functional systems. FEF generates signals sufficient to select targets and initiate the generation of eye movements. It represents therefore an essential node in the network that ultimately controls gaze. The two medial frontal areas, ACC and SEF, seem not to be directly involved in the primary control of eye movements (Stuphorn et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2003). Instead, they seem to monitor performance, registering whether the actions that are produced lead to the desired consequences or not. These findings led to the working hypothesis that the medial frontal cortex might be part of an secondary executive control system. The results of SEF microstimulation indicate that supervisory control signals bias the ongoing response selection in the oculomotor system and thus close the loop between the two control systems (Stuphorn et al., 2002). This additional control enables the agent to achieve a more adaptive match between behavior and the ever-changing demands of the environmental setting. Currently, I plan two different sets of experiments to learn more about the executive system and self-control.",Krieger 338 | Lab: Krieger 362,Krieger Hall,https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/86

Fracture Mechanics: fracture and failure of rate dependent materials.","We are broadly interested in studying the mechanics of soft engineering and biological materials using an integrated experimental and modeling approach. In particular, we are interested in adaptive materials that  can  exhibit dramatic changes in microstructure, mechanical properties, and  macroscopic shape in response to an environmental stimulus.

Engineering soft adaptive polymers, such as shape memory polymers, hydrogels, and dielectric elastomers have wide-ranging applications. The ability of these materials to respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., temperature, solvent, pH, and electric field) can be exploited to design deployable multifunctional devices for biomedical applications (e.g. stents, sutures), soft actuators, and energy harvesters.

Soft tissues are nature’s adaptive materials that grow and remodel in response to  mechanical  stimuli.  Growth can induce a macroscopic shape change while remodeling can alter the tissue microstructure and mechanical properties.   Tissues may become stiffer, less anisotropic, thinner with the development of diseases.  A fundamental understanding these processes is essential to the development of innovative diagnostic techniques and therapeutic treatments. 

The mechanical behavior of soft adaptive materials is complex often exhibiting large deformation, anisotropy, and viscoelasticity. Further complicating matters, adaptive behavior involves the coordination of multiple coupled physical phenomena, including thermal, mechanical, chemical, and electrical processes, as well as an evolving microstructure, such as in the case of remodeling for tissues and phase transformation for polymers. Our work seeks to develop innovative experimental tools and theoretical as well as computational models to investigate the fundamental microscale mechanisms and microstructural origins of the behavior of soft adaptive materials.",125 Latrobe Hall,Latrobe Hall,https://nguyenlab.wse.jhu.edu/

It is well established, primarily from NMR spectroscopy, that folded proteins undergo local conformational fluctuations that involve transient excursions from the canonical structure. Because of these fluctuations, the native states of proteins are actually ensembles composed of many similar, interconverting conformational microstates. Despite knowledge of their existence, however, the probability and structural character of the microstates sampled by proteins are not well understood, nor is the manner in which these fluctuations are coupled to important functional processes such as catalysis, allostery, and signal transduction.

Research in our lab is focused on the experimental characterization of conformational fluctuations, the development and refinement of a general ensemble-based model for fluctuations, and the projection of this thermodynamic model into genomic analysis. Our goals are to unify the description of protein behaviors in such a way as to understand their relationships at the phenomenological level, to codify these relationships in a simple structure-based model, and to apply our model to a number of experimental systems that can be used to test and refine our approach.",Mudd 123,Mudd Hall,https://krieger2.jhu.edu/biology/labs/hilser/index.html

M. tb. is phagocytosed by macrophages but manipulates and subverts both the cell and subsequent immune responses to perpetuate its own survival. M. tb. is an obligate human pathogen. Most commonly it survives in humans by entering a long-lived state of latent infection lasting decades. Later, during aging or immunosuppression it reactivates to cause active disease with significant lung damage and transmissibility to new susceptible human hosts.

In our pathogenesis work, advances include the discovery that M. tb. secretes pathogen-derived cAMP as well as the STING-agonist cyclic di-AMP into the macrophage cytosol where these second messengers subvert host cell signaling and lead to aberrant immune responses.

We have pioneered the understanding of the cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic α-synuclein, learning that lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an essential receptor that mediates the internalization of α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) (Science 2016). Deletion and inhibition of LAG3 significantly impede α-synuclein pathology spread. This work is selected as one of the 40 key discoveries in 200-years Parkinson’s disease basic research. We have identified amyloid-β precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) as a LAG3 co-receptor that facilitates the neuronal uptake of α-synuclein PFF. Internalized PFF cause Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation and PAR accumulation, converting α-synuclein into a highly toxic strain (PAR-PFF). Both depletion and inhibition of PARP1 significantly inhibit PFF-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration (Science 2018).

","Our laboratory is interested in understanding the neural basis of auditory perception and vocal communication in a naturalistic environment. We are interested in revealing neural coding mechanisms operating in the cerebral cortex and how cortical representations of biologically important sounds emerge through development and learning. Perception and production of communication sounds (e.g. human speech and animal vocalizations) are among the most important behaviors of humans and many animals species. Because of the complexity and behavioral importance of communication sounds, understanding their neural representations in the cerebral cortex will help reveal computational principles that the brain uses to process a wide range of sounds we experience daily such as speech and music. Understanding how the brain processes such sounds will provide invaluable insights into neural mechanisms underlying human language perception as well as how the brain functions during social interactions. We use a combination of neurophysiological methods and state-of-the-art engineering and computational techniques to tackle our research questions.

Study the effects of long-range and high forces generated by cancer cells on tumor microenvironment.
      Some types of cancer cells can generate higher forces compared to their normal counterparts. The high forces can be transmitted over distance at the order of hundreds of microns. There can be two possible effects: (a) activation of mechanosignaling pathways in cells that are not in the immediate proximity of the cancer cells; and (b) mechanical remodeling of the microenvironment as a result of reorganization of fibrillar ECM proteins (see movie below) and subsequent changes in the diffusion rate of secreted substances such as cytokines, microRNAs and exosomes. We are looking into how these effects contribute to cancer pathology.

2. Innovative instrumentation for tissue/cell mechanics studies.
      We design and build instruments for our collaborators to study tissues and cells. So far we have built magnetic tweezers to study stem cell-based patches for heart failure patients, bioprinters to print mini-organs for drug screening, microgravity simulators to study the changes in the cells during space travel, and cell stretcher to stimulate muscle growth. We are looking for enthusiastic undergraduate to join the design team. We have published multiple papers from the efforts. 

3. New imaging platforms and computational super-resolution.
    Recently developed tools in biochemistry, molecular biology, biophysics contribute greatly to advancing our understanding how molecules interact with each other in healthy and abnormal cells. However, sometimes what we know at the molecular level cannot be linearly scaled up to the tissue level; and such “not seeing the wood for the trees” issue arises from the fact that heterogeneity of the tissue is not accounted for.  In order to understand the inter-scale relationship between molecules, cells and tissues in homeostasis and pathology, we will address the issue by developing a new imaging platform and corresponding probes to survey the tissue heterogeneity at single-molecule level by combining coherent diffraction and  compressed sensing for image reconstruction achieving sub-wavelength resolution.

4. Precision medicine by screening for the optimal individual therapy using  high-throughput automated imaging of patients' stem cells
    The recent development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enabled high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify novel therapeutic interventions and design personalized medical treatment. However, current HTS systems can only assess the biochemical effects in 2D cultures. Because 3D tissue constructs promote a more physiologically relevant microenvironment for tissue maturation than the 2D culture, 3D tissues are superior test subjects in drug screening. An appropriate HTS platform is yet to be developed in order to evaluate the biomechanical functions of 3D engineered tissue to determine the cardiotoxicity upon treatments. We propose to develop an ultrafast, personalization-ready HTS platform to serve the purpose. We will test our HTS system using diseased 3D cardiac tissues consisting of cardiomyocytes derived from patients in large quantities. Our technology will measure contraction of muscular tissues at the scales of sub-mm and mm. Compared to the conventional methods, our HTS system addresses the issues of tissue size/geometry restrictions, lengthy and complicated sample preparation, prohibitive costs and other technical difficulties, in addition to drastic improvement in measurement speed, thus permitting HTS in miniaturized engineered cardiac tissues. Moreover, because our system can provide varied mechanical loads, our novel system might improve the predicting power of the screening results.",Latrobe 219,Latrobe Hall,https://meow.wse.jhu.edu/

The intervention consists of self-measured blood pressure monitoring, a mobile health application and support from a community health worker to improve lifestyle to reduce blood pressure. The LINKED-BP Program is part of the American Heart Association-funded RESTORE (AddREssing Social Determinants TO pRevent hypErtension) Network. The student will have the opportunity to advance health equity by testing whether this intervention prevents hypertension in Black and underserved populations.

In particular, I'm interested in the situation where the disease status may be ordinal, and this true disease status, also called the 'gold standard', is unknown due to time/cost constraints, measurement errors or ethical concerns. I've been working on finite mixture models and latent variable models to address these issues. I'm also interested in risk prediction, specifically, in estimation and inference of the incremental values for risk prediction introduced by novel biomarkers or additional risk factors. Recently, I've developed interests in time dependent diagnosis and diagnosis with potentially high dimensional features, such as imaging.","550 N.
